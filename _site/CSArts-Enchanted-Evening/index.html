    "body": "We, the CSArts Newspaper, are an official student-produced publication. As an entity, we aim to serve as a designated open, public forum for freedom of expression for students to freely disseminate information and express their ideas. Under the rights delegated by the First Amendment and California Education Code 48907, we operate without prior review and produces content that reflects the views of the student body (within legal and ethical bounds). Our student editorial board and student staff members assume complete legal liability for the content of the publication. On our part, this includes openly admitting to and promptly correcting mistakes. By holding ourselves accountable for our work, we also are prepared to justify the actions we take and the content we publish. In the case of a student injury or death, coverage will generally take the form of hard news in which we will include the student’s name unless the a parent or student does not want the name to be released. However, we will respect the parents’ wishes for the way in which the student will be covered. Because we aim to deliver accurate information in our content, we will verify all facts surrounding articles both in print and online. Interviewed quotes will have the support of handwritten or voice-recorded transcripts. In the case that we mistake a fact, misquote someone, or publish photos of the wrong person or event in an online article, we will promptly update it with the correct information and make a note when the revision was made. For our print articles, revisions will be made when we publish the content online — unless the article is libelous, offensive, or editorializes a hard news topic, in which we will print a retraction the following issue. Furthermore, because we have the right to no prior review, it is all the more important to apply ethical prudence so that content is produced responsibly, keeping in mind the people’s best interests. The First Amendment’s protections intend to serve not the press, but the people. As journalists, we exercise these rights to thoroughly investigate and report all issues in an unbiased, objective manner. This unbiased method of reporting ensures that we fairly address all sides of an issue to uphold the truth for our readers. We will try to minimize harm by understanding the implications of our work and showing sensitivity to all sides of a story. Electronic media produced by this online newspaper is entitled to the same protections – and subjected to the same freedoms and responsibilities – as media produced for print publication. As such, they are not subject to prior review. These include, but are not limited to, posts, videos and tweets. Here, we try to reflect the voice of the student body as best as we can. Therefore, we welcome all types of feedback and student submissions. We meet bi-weekly on Thursdays. Should you be interested in being a part of the school paper, feel free to stop by during a meeting, sending us an email at sophia. brunet@sgv. csarts. net. These contributions can come in form of student-produced articles and letters, photographs, editorial cartoons and guest opinion writers. We will publish these student submissions online if we determine that the content is truthful and relevant to the student body. We strongly urge student participation in order to encompass the entire scope of the CSArts community. "

    "body": "2023/02/27 - Between the kisses and candy hearts, Valentine’s Day is a celebration of the patron saint of beekeepers, epilepsy, and of course, lovers. Valentine’s Day is a commemoration of the bravery of a man who dedicated his life to nurturing and strengthening the love two people have for one another. The origin of Valentine’s Day began in Rome during the reign of Emperor Claudius the Cruel. Under the Emperor’s iron fist, Rome necessitated a powerful army. However, young soldiers were more focused on dedicating themselves to their families, leaving Emperor Claudius’s military severely lacking. To combat the problem, Claudius decided to ban all marriages and engagements in Rome, catching the attention of a Roman priest by the name of Valentine. Valentine determined that forbidding rituals of love was a devious act, and retaliated against the Emperor in secret. The priest bravely continued to marry young lovers in spite of the Empire’s decrees until he was caught in 270 CE. When Valentine was discovered, he was beaten and beheaded on February 14, becoming a martyr and saint within the Christian church. Valentine’s martyrdom is a symbol of persisting and uplifting love in the face of all odds, and if not for his bravery and values, the candy hearts and chocolate roses would be a slice of imagination. Valentine’s Day is not only a couples holiday, but rather a celebration of all love—whether romantic, platonic, familial, or even artistic. The Day of Love is a reminder to us all to uplift ourselves and each other, in spite of any obstacles that may stand in our way. "

On February 4th, CSArts students gathered together to dance with their friends at Winter Formal, held at the Springfield Banquet Hall. The theme of the night was Enchanted Evening, and many dressed in their finest dresses and suits, some with florals, lace, and greens and purples to match the theme.  “For this year’s winter formal theme, we wanted to go for a fantasy vibe, something that was really different from homecoming, Neon Nights. The venue had a whimsical feel and the potential to portray a fairytale scene. ” Jolene Young said, one of the members of the CSArts Leadership dance committee. During the dance, the venue was decorated with a variety of fairy lights, flowers and vines, helping to create a truly ethereal atmosphere to the event. However, despite the beautiful decorations, some were apprehensive of attending the event at first.  “I was kind of worried about distance and finding people to spend time with, but that ended up not being a problem at all. I’m glad I went!” said Rosie Williams (VA ‘23) When asked about the process of choosing a venue, the dance committee said, “all venues are chosen prior to the school year by the leadership advisor. For these venues, the advisor looks at the venue capacity and having various spaces to accommodate all students. We also take into account the location, finding a place in the middle ground. ” No matter the distance or theme, all that were at Winter Formal can confirm that it was truly an enchanted evening to remember.

    "body": "2022/11/15 - Wedding bells rang, wedding bells chimed. In case you missed it, the Musical Theater Conservatory put on an early fall production of The Drowsy Chaperone. The show opened with a charming old man playing a record that ushered in a heartfelt comedy, titled The Drowsy Chaperone, about a beautiful actress quitting the glitz and glamour of show business to marry the man of her dreams. Behind the red curtain and bright lights, the relationships between the actors and their characters set the stage for a successful run. Many of the actors took it upon themselves to research their characters thoroughly in their own ways. Sawyer Valin (MT ‘23), who played The Man in the Chair, even contacted the actor who played his role in the original production of the show, Bob Martin, to flesh out his character as much as possible. Jolie Wang (MT ‘23), who played Mrs. Tottendale, the bubbly socialite with an enthusiasm for weddings, watched different videos of her Drowsy character.  I built my version of Mrs. Tottendale out of [the videos]. I sort of pieced together bits of all the Mrs. Tottendales I watched,” said Wang. Though the show’s run at CSArts has come to an end, the cast of The Drowsy Chaperone will remember the family they formed and the lessons they learned through rehearsing, performing, and embracing the show.  You have so much more freedom and possibility as an actor when you are diligent with your character breakdown work, supportive of every member of your cast, production team, and crew, and consistently eager to learn about the show itself and the exciting process of putting on a show,” Tara Moran (MT ‘23), who played Janet van de Graff, said. Students learned to dedicate themselves to their roles thoroughly and make the most of their rehearsal time to produce a masterful performance for everyone to enjoy. The Drowsy Chaperone was the semester’s first performance, kicking off the new school year with comedy, music, and a reminder of what CSArts truly values: celebrating and honoring art as a community.

    "title": "Masters in Makeup",
    "body": "2022/11/15 - Makeup is an artform that allows us to express ourselves via colors and patterns, textures and techniques. At CSArts makeup is exactly that, an art form. However, with the rise of assignments and homework, it has grown to be an afterthought, something that is much more optional. With that being said, it is still a prominent part of students’ lives. Makeup, is also an outlet and an expression that crosses differen subcultures and factions becoming an ionic and recognizable feature. Sophomore Levvy Butler says makeup started out as a way for them to fit in. They say they lacked the technique and skill, but are getting more comfortable experimenting with different eyeliner shapes and colors.  So now, I wear makeup because I like the way it looks, and not because I want to look older or fit in or anything. ” Junior, Violet Zeug, says she wears makeup for a different reason. Makeup is less of a routine and more something she uses to improve how she feels. “I guess it’s some kind of insecurity, as far as feeling the need to be prettier/looking nicer/put together. ” For her, makeup is a tool, to improve her day and to make her feel prettier. Not only that, but it also goes with what she plans to wear. For example, when she wears her leather jacket, she’ll wear thick eyeliner, but for a more laid back look, she uses thinner and much more breezy eyeliner. An anonymous student said that for her, makeup is both therapeutic and creative. “It allows me to vent, and paint my emotions on my face, whether that means large pigmented red and black eyeliner, or soft green, and blue eyeshadow. ”Makeup is a creative outlet for her, one that has taken a lot of practice. “I find that there is no other form that allows me to be as creative and free as makeup does. ” Each student uses makeup with different goals in mind. For some it is artistry. For others, it is to fit in, or put on a protective mask. If you are interested in learning more about the world of makeup check out these artists!

    "title": "Review of Crying in H-Mart",
    "body": "2022/02/10 - As an avid Goodreads user, for the last year I have heard nothing but good reviews about Crying in H Mart by Michelle Zauner. After reading, I agree with all the praise that this memoir has received. In Zauner’s book, she explores her experiences with identity, family, grief, culture, and food. Crying in H Mart shares all of Michelle’s struggles with being biracial from childhood when she would feel left out during Korean school to adulthood when she loses her mother, her connection to her Korean heritage.  Sobbing near the dry goods, asking myself, Am I even Korean anymore if there’s no one left to call and ask which brand of seaweed we used to buy? Zauner not only shares about her Korean American experience but also shares about her journey to becoming a successful musician when everything was turning against her. She shares anecdotes throughout the memoir that would inspire any creative. The experiences and life lessons she learned doesn’t only apply to Korean Americans, biracial people, children of immigrants, or creatives but applies to everyone through the ideas she shares about belonging, grieving, and dreaming. The stories Zauner shared evoked memories of my childhood and opened the idea that others have had similar experiences to me. Although I am not a biracial Korean American, some of the struggles Zauner had made me feel seen and I think many others would feel that way about her stories despite being Korean. Her stories of visiting South Korea reminded me of the time I first visited when I was in elementary school, making me long to visit. The vibrant descriptions of the food and sights she saw gave me wanderlust. If you weren’t convinced to visit South Korea in the past, after reading this book you will for sure be looking for tickets to Seoul. The one thing that stood out to me the most about this memoir was the imagery all throughout making the reader feel like they were a side character in every experience. Michelle Zauner’s memoir is a great start if you are wanting to start reading memoirs or want to learn more about the Korean American experience. It is definitely worth reading and deserves all the praise.  “Gwaenchanh-a, gwaenchanh-a,” she said. It’s okay, it’s okay. Korean words so familiar, the gentle coo I’d heard my whole life that assured me whatever ache was at hand would pass. Even as she was dying, my mother offered me solace, her instinct to nurture overwhelming any personal fear she might have felt but kept expertly hidden. Michelle Zauner, Crying in H Mart "

    "title": "Glitz & Glamour — Old Hollywood & Winter Formal",
    "body": "2022/02/10 - On Friday, January 21st, the CSArts Leadership revealed the theme for the long-anticipated Winter Formal. Winter Formal was held on February 5th, and tickets were already sold out days later as students excitedly prepared for the event. The theme for this year’s formal was Old Hollywood. Old Hollywood, also known as Classic Hollywood, is a term used to describe the fashion, film, and overall glamour associated with American cinema from the 1930s to the late 1950s. Famous stars from this era would be actresses such as Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, and Judy Garland, as well as actors like Henry Fonda and Marlon Brando. Old Hollywood is legendary, setting trends for both fashion and film. The style of Old Hollywood is full of glitz and glam with an air of both sophistication and class. The women of Old Hollywood would don bright red lipstick and pearly white jewelry, complete with full-length gowns to shine and sparkle. As for the male fashion, sharp fitted suits and tuxedos paired with fedoras and ties were the go-tos for male stars. Their hair would also be stylized to be prim and proper, and most important, quite dapper all together. This year’s Winter Formal isn’t the first instance of taking inspiration from the past either. Earlier this year in October, CSArts had Homecoming, which was themed around the famous music festival Woodstock during the 1960s. The style of Woodstock is a definite contrast to Old Hollywood, involving far less glamour and looser, casual clothing. However, each of the styles have their unique charms to them and are overall staples of American fashion as a whole. It’s safe to say that many at CSArts were ready to party with their friends at Winter Formal, regardless of how red-carpet ready they dressed. After all, Hollywood still remains a beacon of the arts, no matter how much its style evolves and changes. "

			<article class="article-post">                
			<p>As we settle into the second semester of the school year, it’s time to celebrate! On February 4th, CSArts students gathered together to dance with their friends at Winter Formal, held at the Springfield Banquet Hall. The theme of the night was Enchanted Evening, and many dressed in their finest dresses and suits, some with florals, lace, and greens and purples to match the theme.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For this year’s winter formal theme, we wanted to go for a fantasy vibe, something that was really different from homecoming, Neon Nights. The venue had a whimsical feel and the potential to portray a fairytale scene.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jolene Young said, one of the members of the CSArts Leadership dance committee. During the dance, the venue was decorated with a variety of fairy lights, flowers and vines, helping to create a truly ethereal atmosphere to the event. However, despite the beautiful decorations, some were apprehensive of attending the event at first.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I was kind of worried about distance and finding people to spend time with, but that ended up not being a problem at all. I’m glad I went!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>said Rosie Williams (VA ‘23)</p>

<p>When asked about the process of choosing a venue, the dance committee said, “all venues are chosen prior to the school year by the leadership advisor. For these venues, the advisor looks at the venue capacity and having various spaces to accommodate all students. We also take into account the location, finding a place in the middle ground.”</p>

<p>No matter the distance or theme, all that were at Winter Formal can confirm that it was truly an enchanted evening to remember.</p>
