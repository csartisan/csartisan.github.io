    "body": "We, the CSArts Newspaper, are an official student-produced publication. As an entity, we aim to serve as a designated open, public forum for freedom of expression for students to freely disseminate information and express their ideas. Under the rights delegated by the First Amendment and California Education Code 48907, we operate without prior review and produces content that reflects the views of the student body (within legal and ethical bounds). Our student editorial board and student staff members assume complete legal liability for the content of the publication. On our part, this includes openly admitting to and promptly correcting mistakes. By holding ourselves accountable for our work, we also are prepared to justify the actions we take and the content we publish. In the case of a student injury or death, coverage will generally take the form of hard news in which we will include the student’s name unless the a parent or student does not want the name to be released. However, we will respect the parents’ wishes for the way in which the student will be covered. Because we aim to deliver accurate information in our content, we will verify all facts surrounding articles both in print and online. Interviewed quotes will have the support of handwritten or voice-recorded transcripts. In the case that we mistake a fact, misquote someone, or publish photos of the wrong person or event in an online article, we will promptly update it with the correct information and make a note when the revision was made. For our print articles, revisions will be made when we publish the content online — unless the article is libelous, offensive, or editorializes a hard news topic, in which we will print a retraction the following issue. Furthermore, because we have the right to no prior review, it is all the more important to apply ethical prudence so that content is produced responsibly, keeping in mind the people’s best interests. The First Amendment’s protections intend to serve not the press, but the people. As journalists, we exercise these rights to thoroughly investigate and report all issues in an unbiased, objective manner. This unbiased method of reporting ensures that we fairly address all sides of an issue to uphold the truth for our readers. We will try to minimize harm by understanding the implications of our work and showing sensitivity to all sides of a story. Electronic media produced by this online newspaper is entitled to the same protections – and subjected to the same freedoms and responsibilities – as media produced for print publication. As such, they are not subject to prior review. These include, but are not limited to, posts, videos and tweets. Here, we try to reflect the voice of the student body as best as we can. Therefore, we welcome all types of feedback and student submissions. We meet bi-weekly on Thursdays. Should you be interested in being a part of the school paper, feel free to stop by during a meeting, sending us an email at sophia. brunet@sgv. csarts. net. These contributions can come in form of student-produced articles and letters, photographs, editorial cartoons and guest opinion writers. We will publish these student submissions online if we determine that the content is truthful and relevant to the student body. We strongly urge student participation in order to encompass the entire scope of the CSArts community. "

    "body": "2023/10/20 - Each September, Latino and Hispanic people throughout The United States observe their countries’ Independence Day on September 15th! The celebrations of culture and history don’t stop there! Hispanic Heritage Month originally started as a week in August, 1968 by President Johnson. In August, 1988 the week was extended to a month (from September 15th to October 15th) by President Reagan. The declaration was created to celebrate Hispanic/Latino independence days and culture with parades, traditional foods, and parties. The celebration recognizes the 64 million Americans of Hispanic/Latino descent, and their important historical contributions. From political activism, to art, to entreprenuership, Hispanics and Latinos from the U. S have shaped the country into what it is today. Throughout the month, corporations like Starbucks, Target, and Barnes and Noble have participated in Hispanic Heritage month by promoting and incorporating the work of Latino and Hispanic people into their products. Barnes and Noble dedicated a wall specifically for books written by Hispanic authors, while companies like Starbucks and Target released merchandise specifically created by Hispanic artists. At CSArts, Spanish teachers design special lessons during the month in order to teach students about the many different cultures and traditions surrounding people of Hispanic and Latin origin. AP Spanish teacher Andrea Nelson, says the designated month gives students a break from exams, and gives them insight into the culture and the important role the Hispanic and Latino community plays in the U. S.  Recognition and celebration are a good starting point for our year round focus on Latino culture. Two aspects are most important for AP Spanish, Spanish 4 Honors and Spanish 3 Honors: we celebrate by using the language as a means of communication and develop cultural appreciation for Latino influences around the world. ” The learning experience isn’t just focused on books. Students passing by Spanish classrooms in the 400’s will hear music and the sounds of students competing as they play Spanish games in order to deepen their understanding and appreciation of the language and culture. The celebration doesn’t end there! Just weeks after the end of Hispanic Heritage Month, El Dia de los Muertos will begin, honoring and celebrating the lives of those who have passed away. There are many traditions, holidays, and events etched into Hispanic and Latino culture that are worth celebrating and recognizing, as they have such a large impact on the U. S too. To learn more and connect with Hispanic and Latin culture, feel free to pass by a Spanish classroom, visit a LUCHA meeting, or even just watch some classic telenovelas! "

    "body": "2023/10/20 - By now, most of us here at CSArts have heard the new school bell, and we are all asking the same question: “What the hell?” Previous students at CSArts had been hearing the same bell for years, and without warning, change arrived. Week after week, the campus heard a variety of tunes, leaving many students wondering what tune would be assaulting their ears next. Some students like the change, but their opinion doesn’t matter. The majority hate it, like Braedon Younger (CW ‘24). He expressed:  The bell is gonna make me rip out my ears. ” Agreeing with Younger’s opinion, students add on that it sounds like the intune of a popular kid’s YouTube channel, Cocomelon.   The CSArtisan asked the assistant principal, Mrs. Read, to clarify the bell situation.  The PA system works better with a wireless system so that the little chime that [used to] happen at the end of the blocks doesn’t reach… the 400s…[the tune is] too short so we have to elongate it. ” Due to this, Admin experimented with different audios, that came as default tunes with the wireless system such as ones that sounded like a chorus of trumpets, a bass-booted C# note, and a literal fire alarm. In the end, Mrs. Read chose the current bell because of its simplicity and long enough tune. It was not intentionally made to sound like Cocomelon, it was just an arpeggio that came with the default sound pack. If you hate it that much, Mrs. Read did mention that there might be a contest near the end of the year to determine the new bell:  If you want to just spread the word that that’ll be a possibility in the spring, people can start composing whatever they want [for the bell]. ”  "

Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old bell. You fancy me mad. I know the old bell is no more and I am the one responsible for its demise. But yet, hour by hour, day by day, I still hear it. Its haunting melody lingers in my head: Hello, CSArts. Hello, CSArts. Hello, CSArts. We are CSArts. I don’t know what urged me to stay after hours that night. The 5 o’clock bell rang, the new one, the wretched one, and yet I chose to stay. I tried to occupy myself by doing administrative work. But, before I knew it, my eyes began to bear the weight of my work, the pull of slumber creeping up my spine. And then, just like that, I heard it. Hello, CSArts. Hello, CSArts. Hello, CSArts. We are CSArts. This wasn’t in my head. It was as if I heard it bellowing from the PA speakers. I didn’t think much of it for it was late and I was exhausted. It was only an earworm; a catchy, but long-dead tune. I went back to my work. It only became worrisome once I heard the bell again. The same eerie jingle. Hello, CSArts. Hello, CSArts. Hello, CSArts. We are CSArts. I pinched myself to ensure that I was awake and to my dismay, I felt the sharp pain of my own nip linger; proving my consciousness. Hello, CSArts. Hello, CSArts. Hello, CSArts. We are CSArts. It couldn’t be! Have I gone mad? I paced the floor of my office to and fro with heavy, pensive, strides. Hello, CSArts. Hello, CSArts. Hello, CSArts. We are CSArts. It only grew louder - louder - louder! Oh god, what do I do? What can I do? “Villains!” I shriek. “I repent! I’ll revive the old bell! I’ll revive it!” I raved. My head hit the desk and I awoke. A sliver of pale sunlight crept through the blinds of my office. I checked the time on my watch; it read 8:29. Could it be? Was it all a dream? The clock struck 8:30. Hello, CSArts. Hello, CSArts.

    "body": "2023/10/20 - School security dominates national headlines. Concerns about rising rates of violence across the country have led to the implementation of new policies to keep students, teachers and staff safe. This includes practicing emergency drills, educating students on what to look for, and implementing technology to enhance safety around campuses. But what does school safety look like at CSArts? School-wide drills prepare students and staff on what to do and where to go in emergency situations. Staff is also trained in overdose prevention, including the safe administration of Narcan.  As administrators we’re trained in various ways, CPR and First Aid, and we have a nurse. If things are happening, we’ve been trained on how to respond,” assistant Principal, Nicole Read, said. CSArts continues its dedication to campus safety by contracting security staff. The presence of security guards, according to Read, increases the safety and security of the campus, as they can directly identify and manage any kind of internal/external security threats.  Say Cheese, students! You are on camera!” Security cameras are peppered around campus and school administrators say these additions are instrumental in maintaining security. The video cameras provide visuals and double -check student or staff observations of potential security breaches.  We typically have only used them after the fact. So if something is reported and we have to do an investigation, we pull out footage…we can go back and get the information,” Read said. Recently, the school implemented a new form of surveillance that uses live-streaming. The hub for these cameras is in Mr. Metoyer’s office, in the form of a big screen above Mr. Metoyer’s door. The cameras, video and live streamed, in tandem with the other security measures are instrumental in addressing real-time security concerns on campus.  Mr Metoyer saw some people behind the 400s…that didn’t look like students, and it turned out to be parents on some kind of a tour, but it was like- what’s going on? So he radioed security and they checked in,” Read said. While in that instance there were no problems, students and staff should know that the combination of training, staff security, bathroom sensors and the newest technology is keeping The CSArts campus safe. Students are taking notice of the new additions.  I feel that the emergency stations on campus are a great idea. Drugs are becoming a big problem in school,” said one freshman student. The promotion and access to resources on assessing an overdose-related situation is essential, and will ensure that if there is an overdose on campus, there are people with training and Narcan to save a life. While students and school administrators are trained and equipped, school security also relies on students. Students are here for the longest amount of time, and can more easily detect when something might be happening. That’s why CSArts depends on the student body to use the resources available. If you see something, say something! CSArts also has a text-to-tip number that you can use 24 hours a day at 626-531-1271. "

Each year students take simple craft pumpkins home and bring back incredible pieces of art, all part of CSArt’s annual Painted Pumpkin Auction. This year, students came up with a wide variety of innovative designs. Some were sculpted, stacked, hollowed out; some were big, some small, some even sideways. Many featured faces, windows, dioramas, eyeballs, characters from various media and more. Students used paint, clay, glue, and paper to transform the gourds into “gourd”-geously wicked art pieces. Participants shared some reasons why they liked painting the pumpkins and attending the event:  Freedom of creativity, because you can do pretty much anything. ” says Elise Hsu (VA ‘26)  The food. It’s pretty diverse and there’s also gluten free food; it’s hard to get good gluten free food. ” says Yaretzi García Lopez (VA ‘25) “Halloween is one of my favorite holidays so it’s really fun to celebrate it with my classmates. ” -Bonita Hefty (VA ‘28)  Meeting different people, and I feel like the games were fun to play with other people that you might have not met normally. And it was really fun to see all of the pumpkins. ” says Luca Ramos (VA ‘27) The patch of Halloween-themed pumpkins were displayed in the school lobby, where people could place their bets on their favorite design. On the night of the Spooky Painted Pumpkin Bash, students, families and staff joined together in the school cafeteria for a night of costumes, refreshments, and games. Some attendees of the shared which pumpkin they felt was the scariest:  Probably the one titled Yummy. It just scared me, it made me feel itchy,” said one.  I think the scariest for me [was] the lady’s head with the flowing hair coming out. That was really creepy. And the maggot one was a close second,” another one added.  There was one where it was carved out and it had people in it. Not a lot of them were really carved out like that one was, so I thought that was different, that was like ‘ooh, that’s scary’. ” said Khai Dimaculangan (VOC ‘26) At the end of the event, following a thunderous drumroll from the audience, the winning painted pumpkins were announced. The awards given out featured a number of different categories:  Cutest: “Mickey Spooky Treats” by Jayden Vosberg (VA ‘28) Scariest: “Pumpkin Puppy” by Chanel Garcia (VA ‘27) Funniest: “Little C.

    "body": "2023/10/20 - CSArts was built on a foundation of creativity where art meets scholastics. From academics to conservatory, CSArts uses a different approach to learning. Students throughout Los Angeles and Orange Counties brave long commutes because of the many opportunities CSArts offers. The CSArts conservatory doesn’t just attract students, it attracts instructors interested in sharing their knowledge and talents Before coming to CSArts to work as a creative writing instructor, Pasha McKenley worked at two other schools. She taught young children plays and monologues. Her students performed onstage, and those performances ignited a passion in other students throughout the school! From plays to monologues, students took advantage of this new opportunity to share their voices through acting and performing. Students even got the change to perform their own works in slam poetry.  Usually, I was the person bringing creativity to the schools,” McKenly said. This not only increased passion in students for the arts, it also helped improve communication among students and their peers, and improved the culture of the school. Hearing about CSArts, McKenley thought the opportunity to work in a school that focused on the arts would be a good fit. After her first visit, she knew she was meant to teach at CSArts.  There was some guy playing the violin and there were girls tap dancing over there… I was like, where am I? Like on this island of bliss?” While most schools offer artistic opportunites, not all encourage students to follow creative paths. Creative Writing Conservatory Director Timothy Gomez taught at many different schools, each with different ways of incorporating creativity. Gomez said that one middle school where he taught had a decent theater and visual arts program, but that it was limited.  They ended up de-prioritizing their creative skills and finding more traditional pathways, while only exploring their art as a hobby. Or some of our most talented artists ending up leaving our school and going elsewhere to a school that could prioritize their creativity and had the resources for it. ” CSArts prioritized creativity for students and teachers, which led Gomez here last Summer.  I see a real social comfort here that I didn’t see at my other schools. Students feel fully safe to be themselves and explore who they are, and I think this is a product of allowing them to explore their creative lives more fully. I wanted to engage more with my creative life. At CSArts, I get to have the freedom to explore the exact kind of material that I’d like to with my students. And I get to value their creative work in the exact ways that I think matters. ” CSArts continues to attract students and teachers alike because it offers a blank canvas and the tools for success in both academics and conservatory. This balance of art and scholastics continues to produce students who are prepared for their next chapter after graduation. "

    "body": "2023/10/20 - The views expressed in this article are solely those of the student journalist and do not necessarily reflect the views of The CSArtisan or CSArts-SGV. : Have you heard about the blockade in Artsakh? You probably haven’t, which is why we need to raise awareness and educate the people around us. It is crucial for the community to recognize the tragic impacts of this blockade on the Armenian people of Artsakh. Azerbaijan is responsible for the blockade in Artsakh. This oppression of Armenia and Artsakh has existed for too many decades. Turkey and Azerbaijan have teamed together to ethnically cleanse all of Armenia and Artsakh from Armenians. This blockade ran for 9 months and cut Armenians off from the rest of the world and from getting any resources from outside, such as food, medical supplies, and more. Azerbejian even blocked the Lachin Corridor, which is also known as the lifeline of people living in Artsakh. It is the only way people living in Artsakh could get resources. This caused starvation and medical complications, and many innocent people died because of this. The constant refusal of Azerbaijan to lift the blockade violates basic human rights. They are continuing this oppression of Armenians from the Armenian Genocide in 1915, where 1. 2 million Armenians were killed at the Ottoman Empire’s hand. Which is a genocide that Turkey has refused to admit they were responsible for, and spent thousands of dollars to cover it up by paying journalists and news channels to report the Armenian Genocide never happened. Last month, Azerbaijan bombed Artsakh using drones and missile strikes, bombing civilian areas like schools and churches, while their soldiers destroyed cultural sites and artifacts. Azerbaijan soldiers have even gone as far as posting videos of them shooting innocent civilians and destroying graves while laughing. Armenians are being killed by Azerbaijan and Turkey for the reason of them being Armenians. This ethnic cleansing of the people in the Armenian land of Artsakh by Azerbaijan(which is backed by Turkey) needs to end. Turkey and Azerbaijan have targeted Armenians solely based on ethnic hatred. And now, for the first time in 5,000 years, no Armenians remain in Artsakh. It is time to recognize these events and end them so there can be peace in the region. How does this relate to us today? Los Angeles has the largest Armenian population in the U. S. Armenian students at CSArts in the Armenian Student Union (ASU) have been doing everything in the hopes of saving their ancestral land and preventing another genocide. How can you help?: The club is available for anyone to join; it’s for anyone who is interested in helping and advocating for this issue. ASU has been sending emails to government officials in hopes of flooding their inboxes until they have no choice but to help. Any student here that is interested in joining will be an amazing help in making a difference. Simply by reading this article, more people have been educated so this event in history is remembered. ANCA is an organization working to get the U. S. to help its Armenian community and sanction the Azerbaijan government for its crimes. On its website, you can access emails you can send to show your support. "

About FAHM:: October was officially established as Filipino American History Month in November, 2009 at the 111th meeting of Congress to celebrate the contributions to American society by Filipino Americans. October was the chosen month because on October 18, 1587, the first Filipinos arrived in the United states at what is now known as Morro Bay in California. CSArts Student Ideas on Ways to Celebrate FAHM::  Support local Filipino businesses and restaurants.  Learn more about Filipino American History through sources like the Filipino American National Historical Society.  Try cooking dishes from the Philippines! From savory to sweet, Filipino cuisine has everything. You can even try one of my favorite’s, Filipino Adobo! Just acknowledge FAHM. In terms of the various history and heritage months throughout the year, Filipino American History Month flies under most people’s radar. Filipino Representation at CSArts:: According to the 2022-2023 CSArts Handbook, Filipinos made up 2. 74% of the student body here at CSArts. That’s about 24 of the 950 students last year. To celebrate the growing population of Filipino students at CSArts, the Asian American Pacific Islander Club (AAPI for short), is planning on hosting a fundraiser featuring Filipino cuisine and activities at this year’s Spooky Fest. Look for details about the event soon! "

    "title": "A Chat with Mr. Gomez",
    "body": "2023/10/20 - As many people know, Timothy Gomez has become the new conservatory director this year and has quickly become accustomed to his new role. The CSArtisan talked with Mr. Gomez about his passion for writing, his responsibilities as director, and possible future plans. Why do you enjoy writing?:  For me, I got into writing when I was in high school and I really loved it because I was going through a lot in high school, a lot of stuff that I didn’t understand and writing was like the one thing that allowed me to process because I didn’t go to therapy or anything back then. It wasn’t as common to go to therapy, so writing was my therapy. I wrote a lot of journals and I started getting into poetry. I got really into music lyrics and confessional music. That became a way for me to put words to things that I was feeling at a time when I had a hard time processing what I was going through. ” What advice would you give for other writers?:  The times where I’ve been the most productive is when I had deadlines, even if they’re self-imposed. Something that I did when I was at Sarah Lawrence is we did Open Mics every week, so I told myself that every week I was going to read something and it had to be something new. ” How has it been so far being the new creative writing director?:  I love it so far. I mean, I’m coming from a very public school background where I started teaching just regular English and history and so I didn’t get to really focus on creativity at all. It was all academic essays, writing arguments, informative essays, and teaching kids how to research, which is stuff I love, but I very rarely go to do creative writing work with my kids.  And so getting to focus on that has been amazing. All the kids here are so talented and getting to hear all of your guys’ work and getting to hear the kind of stuff that you guys write about and getting to see what you guys care about in terms of what kind of classes you want to have next spring has been amazing. Then I also love that I still get to teach. The fact that I get to do a lot of outside of school work, like running the events, getting master artists, and checking on classes has been really fun. ” What are you looking forward to most this year?:  Sugar Pine. I think I worked on the literary journal at Sarah Lawrence when I was a student there and so I know how much and how much I don’t know how enlightening it can be to get all of these submissions from all of these different students and go through them and decide what goes in and then having this product at the end where a bunch of our students get to say, ‘Hey, I was printed in this really beautiful book. ’ It’s such a good feeling and I’m excited for that. ” What future plans do you have for Creative Writing?:  I’m hoping to do smaller publications through throughout the year. I want to do a horror- zine next month and in addition to doing the bigger Sugar Pine thing, I want to do a bunch of smaller self-published work. Do some more magazines with different themes and where the kids submit pieces and it’s not as edited. ” Anything else you want to add?:  It’s been about a month of school so far already and it’s been so far already and it’s been so fun. I love being on campus here and we had the Open Mic night last week and getting to see all your work was super fun. It’s just getting to spend time with you guys and get to know you guys and understand you as writers and it’s been really fulfilling, so I’m excited. "

    "body": "2023/10/20 - We tip our cowboy hat to you, leadership students. Homecoming was an enormous success – the school can’t stop dancing! Thanks to the members of leadership, the dance was a memorable and fun experience for everyone who attended! Days of effort and planning went into the event. What were the “behind the scenes” of this year’s hoco? The Fairplex in Pomona hosted the first dance of the school year. All of the 2023-2024 venues were chosen last year by Señorita Cardenas, the leadership class advisor, in collaboration with a Leadership Inspirations Coordinator.  Leadership Inspirations is a company we hired to help support dance planning,” says Señorita Cardenas.  Our coordinator and I visited close to eight venues last year all around the area. We did a walk-through of the venues and got a sense of how many students can fit, of the space resources (for example, is there an outdoor seating area? Is there indoor? How big is the dance floor?) We ask all kinds of questions to get a sense of what venues can host our school. ” The Fairplex is covered with gardens of peppers and pumpkins, country decor, and a wonderfully rustic atmosphere – the perfect setting for a hoedown.  The theme highlights the venue space itself,” says Señorita Cardenas.  It wouldn’t make sense to have done [another] theme… because the venue wouldn’t have allowed for that theme. It would have contrasted. ” The theme was decided by the entire class before moving forward with the dance preparation.  [Since] the venue was already picked out for us, we just planned accordingly. We all came to an agreement before starting to plan,” says Alyssa Cho (10th grade, Visual Arts), one of the leadership students. The homecoming decorations emphasized the country qualities of the venue.  We take inspiration from the Pinterest board we created for the dance. Then some of us made an Amazon wishlist of decorations for the admin to order,” says Kaelin Lee, (11th grade, Acting), another of the leadership students.  Decorations were also made, incorporating the creativity of the committee members. The whole process was extremely enjoyable!” Planning any event – especially a school dance – has its difficulties. Preparing for such an eventful occasion could be stressful. However, a student in the leadership class says otherwise:  It was overall a really cool experience – it was the first project of the year we worked on as a team. I felt really connected and we all kind of helped each other throughout the process,” says Alyssa Cho. Since hoco hoedown was the first project, it’s something that will be memorable to the students of the leadership class.  The planning process was easy, with great guidance from the dance coordinators, and the division of work ensured we were on task and everyone was doing something they liked,” says Kaelin Lee. The leadership committee does so much for CSArts: they make sure all of our dances and events are as enjoyable as possible. Homecoming was a great start to a wonderful year of events – we now patiently anticipate the upcoming winter formal and prom. Leadership made hoco as magical as possible! "

Luckily, the school has lots of resources available to make sure you are physically and emotionally well! A brand newly designed Wellness Center is in Room 111, and The CSArtisan reached out to Mrs. Alisha Miranda, special services faculty member, to answer some questions about it! What resources does the Wellness Center provide for students?: The Wellness Center, open Monday through Friday from 8:15am-2:15pm, is designed to be a quiet space, where students can relax and decompress for a few minutes. Students are invited to rest or meditate, read, color or draw, use a relaxation or fidget tool, speak with a counselor, practice evidence-based coping strategies, research wellness topics, listen to music, take a walk, stretch/yoga, do guided breathing, and stay for 20 minutes to utilize all of these resources and more. How can students without a 504 or IEP access the Wellness Center?: Students MUST have a Wellness Center Pass from their teacher, counselor, or another CSArts staff member in order to be admitted into the Wellness Center. You do not need a pass if you are visiting before school or in between classes. In what situations would the Wellness Center be of help to a student?: There are various situations that might cause a student to need to utilize the Wellness Center.  For example, panic/anxiety attacks, depression, restlessness, low motivation, mental health disorders, counseling and guidance, general anxiety, meditation, brain break, or loss of focus.

Just be very attentive and friendly to those you’re working with… Don’t be afraid to ask for help and support, most of the time you will get it if you ask! You’ll have fun no matter what, and enjoy it as best you can. Best of luck to you!”  May Acero (P&amp;D, ‘25) Some tips for doing homework while having rehearsals is getting as much done during the breaks or before rehearsal starts. Then complete anything you can while you have time. Just making the most of what you can with the time you got”  Kayla Rigo (IM, ‘25) Before my first tech week I wished I knew how little sleep you would actually be getting so definitely take time to rest and recharge. Also, I wish I knew that other people are in the same boat as me. We both don’t know the material or where rehearsal will go. You end up making new friends you never thought you would even speak to. ”  Ines Arroyo (MT, ‘25)It is all about balance and using time wisely.

    "title": "Sensors in the Bathrooms",
    "body": "2023/09/25 - One of the most talked about, and perhaps most controversial new additions to the CSArts campus, are bathroom sensors. Students and faculty have many questions about the new technology. The CSArtisan talked with CSArts Principal Dr. Gregory Endelman for details what they do, and why they are needed. First and foremost, students, parents, and teachers have been pushing for ways to make the campus safe from drugs.  This has actually been an ongoing conversation that really has been led mostly by the students, and then their families. Students in various forms have been reporting that they would like the bathrooms to be drug free. ” Last year’s campus-wide lockdown brought student safety into focus.  Some of the students were asking, ‘Can we have a panic button?’ So we looked into a variety of options. And these detection devices were recommended to us,” Endelman said. The sensors have two main jobs: to pick up on smells and sounds.  They detect chemicals in the air that are associated with tobacco products and marijuana products. It also has the capability to detect certain threats. It’s not recording what students are saying in the bathroom …[but] if there’s something happening in the bathroom that spikes noise, it’s going to alert administration” Endelman said. You can thank AI for this new technology.  The way that they are designed, it’s a form of artificial intelligence, and they get hosted by these third parties, through a server. So they’re internet connected. And they do that so they can constantly install updates. But I do suspect that as technology evolves, these things are going to become very, very sophisticated. ” This safety net, while keeping the campus safe, is expensive.  Each device itself is about $1,500 … but this is not like … putting batteries in a regular smoke detector. They have to be wired. They have to be linked to the internet, and they have to be hosted. So the installation for the devices run around $30,000- $60,000. It’s a substantial investment. But it’s one of those things that we … think is important,” Endelman said. While you may not be able to see the sensors, they are installed, working, and adding a new layer of protection on campus. "

    "title": "CSArts PSAT Cancelled",
    "body": "2023/09/25 - As more colleges and universities shift away from standardized testing for admission criteria, CSArts decided on a shift as well. Part of that decision meant The PSAT was canceled. CSArts administrators and counselors cut the PSAT due to declining student interest and the financial strain it put on the school. The cancellation has raised concerns by students and parents because the PSAT provides helpful practice for the SAT, and high scores on the practice test can qualify students for merit awards and thousands of dollars in scholarships. By the time the cancellation was announced and CSArts families started to raise concerns, administrators said that they were, “beyond all of College Board’s deadlines for establishing our school’s PSAT administration, ordering exams, collecting payment, and registering students to test. ” This resulted in many students scrambling to find a solution, mostly looking to other local schools. The problem, however, is that many schools don’t allow outside students to take the test. CSArts is in the process of talking with Duarte Unified to figure out a solution. Duarte Unified has offered to register students and host the PSAT for CSArts students. The details of the deal between CSArts and Duarte are still being worked out. The CSArtisan asked student counselor, Ms. McMillen, what students could do as an alternative in order to be eligible for scholarships similar to The National Merit Scholarship. McMillen said that students can find other scholarship resources updated monthly on Student Square in the “your counselor section. ” The issues regarding future standardized testing at CSArts and nationally raises important questions regarding the importance of tests for college admissions and the impact on student opportunities. It should also serve as a reminder of the necessity for clear dialogue between administrators and students regarding the changing landscape. Although the PSAT may be less important for college admission, there are still valuable opportunities for students that must be considered. "

    "title": "A Chat With Counselor Christy",
    "body": "2023/09/25 - New schedules, new classes, new teachers, college essays, APs, the list of what a new school year entails goes on and on. It’s scary; it’s stressful; it’s overwhelming, and it’s a lot of work. However, it can be manageable. All it takes is a little bit of guidance, and the making of some good habits. The CSArtisan has the top 4 tips and tricks to have a productive and stress free school year, brought to you by one of CSArts’ very own school counselors, Ms. Christy. Tip #1: Make to-do lists and take it one step at a time!: With deadlines approaching and assignments piling up, it can be hard to not get overwhelmed. Sometimes, big to-do lists can be astonishingly long, and so it can be helpful to “prioritize in terms of what’s urgent and most important, and then make a smaller to-do list… starting with little chunks,” Christy says. By separating your to-dos into smaller chunks, breaking it into a more manageable manner, motivation can be boosted, and, “It can make you feel more accomplished and increase focus because you feel like you’re actually getting something done. ” Tip #2: Use a planner or other organizational tools!: With Seniors being faced with the challenging task of college applications, Freshmen still adapting to the ropes of highschool, and other students being thrown into the new schedules and classes that come with starting a new grade, it can be difficult to stay organized. One tip that Ms. Christy has is to “have a blue day and a gold day binder” or a planner to keep the two schedules separated. For Seniors, Christy suggests that “getting organized first is one of the best things that you can do. This is a really great time to get organized because deadlines aren’t quite happening yet. ” It can be really helpful to create “Excel sheets, or some kind of organizer or trackers of all the schools that you want to apply to, and then all the upcoming application materials that you need” so that it can all be in the same place. Tip #3: Utilize office hours!:  Utilizing office hours is going to be one of the most helpful things that you can do here at CSArts. ” Christy says. With many schools not offering one-on-one time for students to interact with teachers, office hours can be an incredibly helpful tool.  Utilizing even 25 minutes twice a week can be a really great opportunity to get some studying done, rather than waiting till you get home. ” Tip #4: Take care of yourself and don’t forget to have fun!: Starting a new school year can be stressful and draining for everyone. CSArts requires a lot of hard work and dedication, and the school days are long.  I always recommend making sure to get enough sleep,” Christy says.  That’s when our brain grows the most, when you’re of this age. ” It’s also very important to “bring plenty of snacks for conservatory and utilize office hours to get some homework done. ” Social aspects are also vital in having a productive and fun school year, and so Ms. Christy suggests getting involved in some of the many clubs at CSArts. Finding other people to bond over similar interests can be really helpful, especially for Freshmen and other new students. Also, don’t forget that you don’t have to sign up to a club right away at Club Rush, you can still join any time! For more information or advice, contact your school counselor, Ms. Shiroma (grades 9-11, A-F, and grade 12, A-G), Ms. Christy (grades 9-11, G-M, and grade 12, H-O), or Ms. McMillen (grades 9-11, N-Z, and grade 12, P-Z) "

    "title": "Classy Classrooms",
    "body": "2023/09/25 - The creative classrooms of CSArts reflect our unique student body. From math classes to Mandarin 1, the academic classes are just as inventive as conservatory courses. Teachers shape their lesson plans to fit their specific goals of the class; it is rare to find two classes that are exactly the same. The creativity of teachers is apparent in their classrooms. In Room 101, the walls of Mr. Bowman’s classroom are covered with posters, student work, and shelves of mementos.  Keeping someone’s attention for a full ninety minutes can be really difficult. When students start to space out, they can find something in the room that interests them. Wherever they look, there’s something to see,” says Mr. Bowman. His classroom is famous for its calm environment, stock of emergency granola bars, and other essential supplies available for all students.  I want it to be a welcoming space; that’s my goal. ” Just a few doors down is Mr. Y’s math class in Room 105, where his students try to fill the “mistake counter” by spotting any mistakes in his lesson.  I think it keeps them a little sharper and more focused,” says Mr. Y.  Every year [the students] get more and more creative with finding math mistakes. ” Many of Mr. Y’s students also know of the xylophone in his classroom, which he originally received as a gift.  I thought it was a strange gift, so I thought it’d be even stranger to bring it to school,” he says.  I like to play children’s songs, like the one about the lamb. Someone had a little lamb. ” However, creativity isn’t always shown through physical objects and settings. It can also be shown in the ways teachers manage their classrooms. In Mandarin 1, which is located in Room 401, most of the vocabulary isn’t pre-planned. Instead, the teacher, Nana Yang, asks the students questions such as what they did on their weekend. She translates their response into Mandarin Chinese. This results in a lot of varied vocabulary. She says that she was inspired by how parents used to ask questions to their children to teach them Chinese.  A lot of times the questions are based off of daily life,” she explained.  So most of [the] topics [we learn in class] are based on real life situations. ” Mr. Pegan, who teaches Early World History in Room 301, also has an interesting approach to teaching. The questions on his assignments have to do with forming an opinion about the topic, not memorizing historical facts like you would expect.  A lot of highschool math or a lot of highschool history isn’t driven as much by being able to remember names and dates,” he says. “It’s driven by using historical facts to make an argument. ” Also, Mr. Pegan doesn’t lecture for most of the class. Instead, he gives the students nearly all of class time to work on assignments. When asked why he made this choice, he said,  Lecture’s a more passive form of teaching. By having you dig in and having to do all the work, you’re the center of the learning. ” He added that this also gives him time to answer questions and help students with the assignment. These are only a few examples of how CSArts is a school where both students and teachers can express their creativity. These teachers choose to make creative or pleasant classrooms all over the CSArts campus, whether this is through aesthetic decorations and physical objects, or the way they manage their classroom. Every teacher gives their students the opportunity to learn and grow in a unique environment. "

    "body": "2023/09/25 - As schools begin to embrace the digital age, teachers find their own ways to combat distractions and make sure students stay on task. Imagine, you’re sitting in your English class, writing a long, tedious essay. Leaning back in your chair, you stifle a groan. You feel you’ve worked hard for a solid 30 minutes, and deserve a break. You glance towards your teacher who seems to be paying no mind to what you’re doing, too engrossed in their own matters. You move your cursor across the tabs, switching to one you feel will offer more entertainment, but before you can truly engage with it, you’re met once again with your English essay. Looking back at your teacher, they peer at you with a cunning glare. You know then, with absolute certainty this is none other than the work of GoGuardian. As of the 2023 school year, CSArts has decided to implement GoGuardian into the classroom. GoGuardian is an educational technology company that allows teachers to monitor their students’ online activity, filter content, and alert school officials of threatening (either to self or other) behaviors on the district owned chromebooks. It is primarily used as a monitoring service to help students stay focused and engaged with their classroom tasks. Michael Turf, a history teacher at CSArts welcomes the new system into his classroom this year.  It’s a brand-new system that the school is using and a bit of an adjustment period, but I am happy the school is investing in programs that support students and teachers in the classroom. ”  GoGuardian was brought on board to help with staying focused and provide students with some focus and guidance from these distractive behaviors. Especially teaching AP classes, classroom time is extremely valuable, and GoGuardian allows me to monitor student computer behaviors and provide interventions throughout class time. GoGuardian provides a platform for me to intervene without calling attention to a specific student in front of the Class, ” said Turf. A student in Ms. Nelson’s class also agrees that GoGuardian can be helpful.  The only teacher that I have that uses it is my Spanish teacher. She uses it all the time so I think she likes it. I don’t really mind it. It keeps me on track and forces me to do my work. ” Not Everyone Is A Fan: While monitoring all students’ screens may make it easier for teachers to intervene, is constant supervision the best route to take? While teachers do think that it is helpful for classroom control, students might not like the idea of being monitored for doing their work.  I think it can enhance classroom productivity,” Emma Thompson, an English teacher who decided not to use the monitoring application says,  but it can also create tension in a classroom. “ Students had different opinions on the use of GoGuardian.  It used to bother me (especially in elementary school) when I would want to play online games instead of working in class,” One student said.  But now I have to admit it’s good for staying on task and preventing people from cheating during tests,” said one anonymous student. Another student argues that it causes them stress in class, disrupting their work time.  Sometimes I feel like I have to pretend that I’m doing my work even though I’m actually doing my work. ” "

    "body": "2023/05/19 - As the school year comes to an end, it’s important to recognize some people who helped us make this year so fun. Our co-class presidents took it upon themselves to not only take on the responsibility of being a voice for us students, but giving us a memorable school year. From cocoa and cram sessions, to senior sunrise, the class presidents put in the work! Here are some of their personal highlights of the year: A message from one of your Class of 2023 co-presidents::  A highlight from this year was definitely our Senior Sunrise! We had so much fun coming together as a class, especially with the knowledge that we would gather once more for Senior Sunset, months later. The best part of being class presidents is getting to put ideas into action. We usually start with, “Wouldn’t it be cool if…?” and then we get to see those ideas come to fruition! For Halloween, we wanted to do something of our own for the school, so we had seniors drive their cars onto the field and host games out of the trunks. Executing ideas is exhilarating because it’s like seeing your Pinterest board brought to life! Class of 2023, you are amazing. You are strong and persistent in the face of opposition, and now that the work is done, we can’t wait for the best Grad Week ever. To the underclassmen/almost-seniors, our advice is to appreciate your fellow students’ work. One day, you’ll be leaving, and you’ll wish you saw the All School Musical or watched the IM Jazz Ensemble, or spent more time observing the Visual Art showcases. Not everyone is surrounded by so much art and talent in high school, so take advantage of the opportunities you have now to watch that person you sit next to in math belt their face off, because one day they might be on Broadway (and those tickets will be much more expensive)”  Bella Chang and Tati Bovia (IA ‘23)A message from one of your Class of 2024 co-presidents::  Some of my favorite parts about being class president this year have been planning events, getting to add to the CSArts culture and work on school involvement, and really just being the voice of the junior class. One of my most memorable experiences this year has definitely been Junior Campout which my co-president and I planned and advertised for months. It was so rewarding seeing all of our hard work pay off at the event! My current co-president and I will be running for senior class president and hope that everything we have done this year has prepared us for next year. To the class of 2024, good luck with working on college applications within the next 6 months, and keep pushing through! We got this!”  Hannah Pung (BCD ‘24)A message from one of your Class of 2025 co-presidents::  My favorite part about being this year’s class president is honestly wearing the maid dress after getting elected. As well as just being able to represent your class is really nice. My advice to any future presidents is that it’s important to be yourself and to do it all for your class and not yourself, have fun too! And I’d just like to say that the Class of 2025 is honestly the best class!”  Giovanni Huang (P&amp;D ‘25)A message from your Class of 2026 co-presidents::  It was a bit difficult to learn how to manage to fit in time for planning and discussion into a jam-packed schedule. Our favorite moment from the year was the first pep rally of the year. We loved seeing everyone so determined and working together on the games. Most importantly, cheering for our fellow classmates was really nice to be a part of. As for advice to future presidents, iron out your schedule for the year, sit down and review your calendar with your partner, and plan! Myself and Zakai have loved building relationships with the class; learning about each and every one of you has been amazing. We are going to finish the year strong with Clash of Classes and run head first into sophomore year!!!”  Francis Fontana (MT ‘26) and Zakai Haynes (MT ‘26)The CSArtisan sends out a special thank you to all of our class presidents for their hard work and dedication! As for the next school year, there are many different presidential campaigns running this month with amazing candidates running to earn the spot as class presidents. So, make sure to cast your vote for the next co-class presidents as soon as you can! "

    "body": "2023/05/19 - Every year, the CSArts conservatory closes the season with a showcase highlighting their artistic abilities, whether it be performances or galleries. Among the flurry of end-of-the-year recitals and art exhibitions, the Creative Writing Conservatory quietly says goodbye through their respective niche: in the pages of a book. Sugar Pine Literary Magazine is CSArts’s official literary magazine, operated and edited by Creative Writing Conservatory students. Sugar Pine is a collaborative effort that allows students in each conservatory to express themselves without the confines of artistic factions. Every year, students are encouraged to submit their creative works, ranging from paintings, short stories, and poetry, to photography of any subject, spanning from dancers to set designs. My experience with Sugar Pine began in ninth grade. I went in not knowing much about the class I had signed up for, but excited at the promise that I would get to assist in creating a published piece of work. My naivety was a blessing because I experienced Sugar Pine without expectations, receiving an honest look into what made our magazine so special. Typically dominated by seniors, Sugar Pine is almost always intimidating for younger students. For me, being around more experienced peers was intimidating; however, once I saw how welcoming and helpful they were, I quickly became infatuated with the dedication of a team as spectacular as the Sugar Pine staff. The staff operates with the utmost respect and care for each other, collaborating and discussing frequently to create a beautiful result. I am now a senior, and I have had the honor of being a prose team editor, facilitating group discussions and working with fellow editors to organize each submission into a beautiful magazine. As I prepare to graduate in a few weeks, my heart is filled with memories from my four years at CSArts, and I am forever grateful that the Sugar Pine family fills the bulk of that space. Sugar Pine has been the highlight of my high school experience, and I hope it can recreate that same sense of fulfillment for future creative writing students and aspiring editors. As thrilling and dynamic as room 210’s editorial space is, none of our beloved magazines could have been possible without the excellent guidance of Sugar Pine’s faculty advisor, Mrs. Estella Ramirez. An endless source of support and positivity for every student involved, Mrs. Ramirez’s dedication toward her students—and Sugar Pine as a whole—made the experience gratifying. This year was Mrs. Ramirez’s last as the advisor for Sugar Pine and there’s no denying she and every student working on the magazine put in the effort to make Volume 6 the best, most beautiful issue yet. On behalf of all Sugar Pine staff, past and present, we extend our gratitude to Mrs. Ramirez for her kindness, encouragement, and compassion throughout our journeys in the conservatory. You have left a lasting impact on every student in the Creative Writing Conservatory in such an impactful, memorable way, and we are all filled with gratitude for the years we’ve spent under your wings.

    "title": "Memories with Mr. Blaylock",
    "body": "2023/05/19 - Mr. Blaylock embodies all that is good about our school. His positive energy, boundless enthusiasm, deep commitment to excellence, endless creativity, and heart-felt dedication to his students all reflect the best possible qualities of a director of a program at an arts school. Commitment to the development of students’ artistic talents is in Mr. Blaylock’s DNA. His father, James Blaylock, started the creative writing program at OCSOA. Both programs are modeled after graduate-level Masters of Fine Arts programs, and their depth and breadth are incredibly impressive. There are few programs like it in the entire country. The creative writing curriculum developed by Mr. Blaylock has exposed students to a wide variety of writing styles over the course of the program. He brought in a wide array of writers for our master classes. He developed a relationship with Citrus College so that we could have access to college-level conservatory classes. He helped us produce an amazing literary magazine, Sugarpine, every year. Mr. Blaylock developed creative writing classes that served needs in the community– the Creative Nonfiction class connected students with their elders at a local senior center, and the Theatre for Young Audiences course introduced students to elementary school students. Open-mic nights gave students the opportunity to share their work with others, not just at school, but at Vroman’s Bookstore in Pasadena. Mr. Blaylock has been loved by not only the creative writing conservatory students– he has fans from every other conservatory on campus. This is no accident.  Mr. Blaylock has always been very intentional about reaching across conservatory lines, as is evidenced in the mini-musicals program and the Peter Pan class. Students have been eager to share their fondest memories of Mr. Blaylock. One of Levvy Butler’s (CW ‘25) fondest memories with him took place after school,  I came in to talk to him about something he was working on and he explained it to me, and I didn’t feel like I was being talked down to at all. He mentioned a part that he was struggling to figure out, and it was really cool to see that he was a normal person who was looking for solutions to things in his writing, the same as me. ” Julia Pilch (CW ‘24) loved hearing about Mr. Blaylock’s childhood stories. One of her favorite ones was when he was talking about Mr. Fish, a character he made up.  He and his friends had passes to Disneyland and one summer they would go around saying “vote for Mr. Fish!” and then all of the workers would be confused. But eventually, all of the workers recognized him and would do a fishlike motion when he walked by. ” Sevana Zadoian’s (CW ‘23) favorite memory was the senior showcase she and her classmates put on,  He worked really hard to give us the best possible experience and send off in our last year. ” Samantha Thomas’s (CW ‘24) favorite memory of Mr. Blaylock was one of his classes–  Whenever I’m in a Blaylock class, there always comes a point where his lectures and our discussions take turns into more introspective territories, and this was especially true in our Peter Pan class last semester. I feel like Mr. Blaylock has such a connection and command of childhood and youth which were the central themes of the class. You can always tell how much he loves talking about how childhood and youth reflect so much of ourselves. I feel like we as teenagers often want to keep fragments of childhood with us, but also want to appear mature. And Blaylock really has always provided such a space to be mature and have beautiful conversations about life while also keeping this glow of youth about everything. I feel like Blaylock understands us.  Never have I had a teacher that truly understands and emphasizes the process of growing up. You can tell how much he loved teaching that class and how much he wanted us to get out of it. From him letting us play dress up and create stories from photographs, it was the blend of fun, passion, and heart that made Neverland one of the most fun classes I’ve ever taken. ” Mr. Blaylock’s friendly presence as conservatory director is cherished by everyone, students and faculty alike. We all are thankful for the memories we have made with him and are so excited to see what’s in store for him in the future, whether here at CSArts or somewhere else entirely. Thanks for everything, Mr. Blaylock. "

    "body": "2023/05/19 - On May 6th, the cafeteria at CSArts was transformed into an art gallery, as the seniors of the Visual Arts Conservatory held their final showcase, exhibiting their best works that they have created throughout this year and their time at CSArts. From ceramics to acrylic paint, to even mixed media, the seniors were able to discuss their work with others and their artistic journey, and what the future has in store for them as this school year comes to a close. When it came to actually selecting the work they wanted to display, the seniors debated on the pieces they were most proud of.  I knew that I wanted to showcase work from different years that I’ve been at CSArts,” said Rosie Williams (VA ‘23)  I was able to pull things from a few different places and I’m really happy with how it came out! I found a piece in my garage from my sophomore year that I completely forgot about and I am really glad that I was able to put that in there. ”  The process of selecting works for the exhibition for me was mainly just looking through all of my sketchbooks and art pieces and deciding which of them would go with the vibe I wanted. It also included a lot of ignoring insecurities and putting pieces up regardless because you are trying to get over those struggles among your own art,” said Aria King (VA ‘23) When asked about her favorite piece on display, Rosie said,  My proudest piece is the portrait series I did of my bestie Aria. We were asked to practice portraits from different angles in our anatomy drawing class, and we chose to draw each other! I spent a lot of time on these drawings and I’m really proud of them. plus they actually look like her!” For Aria, her favorite work revolved around the medium she chose to create it from.  I think my favorite piece that I put up was one of the portraits I did of Patti Smith just because I got better at using gouache through it and I just liked the way it turned out,” she said. Since this exhibition is the last show these seniors will experience in their high school career, there is an abundance of emotions felt for this event.  This exhibition means the closing of a chapter for me. I was at the same school for eight years before coming here, so four years went by like nothing. I’ve been able to learn so much about myself and about the world in the short time that I’ve been here, and I’m so lucky to have shared this journey with such amazing people. This is the first exhibition that I’ve truly been proud of, both in the art that’s up there and in what it symbolizes for me, and it’s really an embodiment of the work we’ve done together,” said Rosie.  I think that what the exhibition meant to me was a celebration of the art that every senior has made and the fact that we have grown up, learned, and made mistakes, but we all have our own ways of expressing ourselves. It’s a celebration of similarities and differences among our collective creative energies. ” said Aria.  After the exhibition ended, I just felt really bittersweet, things are ending and some of the people I have come to know over the last four years I will never see again. It’s very much a feeling of joy that it took place, but also feeling how temporary it all is. It’s a very sad and happy state to be in. ” One thing is for certain, that no matter where these seniors go in the future, their hard work and dedication deserves to be appreciated and celebrated. Some of their artwork is still on display in the entrance, so be sure to stop by! "

    "title": "AP or Dual Enrollment? Which is better?",
    "body": "2023/05/19 - Every spring, students at CSArts debate on whether they’ll take AP courses or Citrus College classes. For some, this debate goes on throughout the summer, and some hope for the best in the fall about their decision. But even after having put in so much thought, is one actually better than the other? On one hand, AP courses tend to have a higher demand of students interested rather than Citrus classes. This is due to the prestigious look of it on transcripts, as it shows that students were able to challenge themselves throughout their high school careers. Although even with such advantages, AP courses also have their downfalls; they demand a strong work ethic and resilience. Throughout the year, students are expected to prepare themselves for the final AP exam through countless homework assignments and lengthy tests. This can be hard for CSArts students to manage considering the extra work of conservatory many have to manage, as well as rehearsals and shows to prepare for. In addition, college credit for these courses is also not always guaranteed. According to the CSArts handbook, students will only receive credit after passing a two to three-hour-long exam. This is a huge deciding factor for most students, considering that if you fail the exam, then you may feel that it was all a huge waste of time and money, since the exams usually cost a certain fee in order to take the test. On the other hand, Citrus College courses differ between subjects depending on if it is popular during a certain year. The difficulty of these classes ranges depending on the subject. Overall, Citrus College courses can be considered to be the “easier” option because of the automatic college credit granted if students pass the class, no matter what. These courses are also free of charge, and are a lot less anxiety-inducing when it comes to exams and credit. Dual enrollment courses, like AP classes, also offer a GPA boost for students. However, some students seem to dislike the structure of Citrus College classes, considering it isn’t your typical high school class, and while it can be good practice for college, it can be a hard adjustment for some people. Grade formatting isn’t the same as in regular classes, and student and teacher relationships can be hard to establish depending on the class. There are also many student complaints about the Canvas platform used in Citrus classes, due to the confusing structure of grade reports and assignments. Therefore, all aspects of AP courses and Citrus College courses should be taken under consideration before making a decision on which to take. As students prepare for the upcoming school year, it is also important to hear what their counselors have to say about AP and dual enrollment courses. Counselors will be able to help students take in both pros and cons of the two choices and support them in coming to the best decision.  For students already enrolled in an AP course, it makes sense for them to take the test at the end because you already work so hard the whole year. So, might as well take the exam and see if you can get college credit for it. Although if you are debating between taking an AP course in the fall or a CCC college course, it all depends on the student. Both can give you college credit but dual enrollment is automatic just by passing the class. For the AP courses, you have to pass the exam. So personally, I am biased, and I would lean towards the dual enrollment classes,” said Ms. Shiroma, one of the counselors here at CSArts. Teachers who teach these college level courses are also a great source for more in depth information regarding the course, considering they are highly aware of student habits and common experience among the school population.  The fact that the college credit all comes down to one exam might be stressful for some students. On the other hand, having to focus on preparing for an exam might provide some students with a clearer vision of what they need to do in the class. Of course, both AP and CCC classes are going to have college level work expected… In terms of deciding, it is important to think about whether you want to focus on taking an exam or not. The AP exam is a multi-hour exam, and it will require extra preparation time outside of class. The CCC class doesn’t have that type of all or nothing exam but it does have several writing assignments that are challenging. The courses are just different and one might work better for different students,” said Mr. Pegan, who teaches the community college course for US history. School staff and students have very distinct perspectives on whether or not which course is better, and opinions vary based on your plans for the future and your current circumstances. Students who experience the courses firsthand have a more valuable take on how both courses can affect their academic or social life. Here is what some students had to say about their experiences in both courses:  The dual enrollment classes can sometimes have an exaggerated workload which can interfere with your personal life but in the end, I’d say it is less harsh than AP courses”  Alina Ayala (VA ‘25) Citrus classes tend to be less manageable and more professional, leading it to be more difficult. Although sometimes it can be the better route to go down because AP tests are expensive and it isn’t as important when you’re an underclassman”  Kayla Rigo (IM ‘25) AP classes are decent as long as you keep up with the work. They also have very helpful benefits if you take advantage of them”  Joann Cruz (VA ‘24) Emotionally AP classes are overwhelming to a degree, depending on the student. They have their advantages academically but it takes a lot of commitment. Depending on the subject I would take an AP class again”  Maddalena Cano (VA ‘25)In the end, there is no “perfect” option for every individual. The demands of the classes differ and the factors that come into the decision-making such as testing, course work, and even what one wants in their high school experience. There are pros and cons to both sides, but the best choice is to go with what suits you the best. "

    "body": "2023/03/31 - On March 17th, CSArts students wore their best green clothes to celebrate Saint Patrick’s Day. St. Patrick’s Day is celebrated annually on March 17, which is the death anniversary of Saint Patrick. But who is Saint Patrick, and why do we celebrate him? Saint Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland and its national apostle. He was born in Roman Britain, and was then kidnapped and brought to Ireland as a slave at 16. He would later escape, but would later return to Ireland. He is often credited with bringing Christianity to its people. By the time of his death on March 17, 461, he had established monasteries, churches, and schools. There are a variety of myths and legends regarding Saint Patrick. One of the most notable is how he was the one to drive the snakes out of Ireland, or how he used the native shamrock of Ireland to explain the Holy Trinity. The traditions of Saint Patrick’s Day have evolved over the centuries. The city of Chicago dyes its river green, and other cities hold parades, where thousands of people, Irish and non-Irish alike, gather together to celebrate the holiday. Corned beef and cabbage are associated with the holiday, and even beer is sometimes dyed green as well. Whether you believe in Irish luck or not, the holiday of Saint Patrick’s Day is a fun way to celebrate the history, mythology, and culture of the Irish people. "

    "body": "2023/03/31 - At the 95th Academy Awards, Everything Everything All at Once lived up to its name. This genre-bending film took home seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and several acting awards. Other successful movies were The Whale, which garnered two awards, one of which was for Brendon Fraser’s acting comeback, and All Quiet on the Western Front, which won many technical awards. CSArts students reflected on the record-breaking night and who they wished had won. Rhys Shaw (ACT ‘23) was overjoyed with Everything Everywhere All at Once’s win.  1,000% Everything Everywhere All at Once deserved to win. I think it’s a very unconventional movie. And it tells a story in a way that we’ve never seen before, that hasn’t been told that has been needing to be told. It’s been a great platform for much-needed Asian representation in mainstream media. It revived the career of Ke Huy Quan, who deserved it more than anybody else. It allowed Jamie Lee Curtis to go beyond the Halloween franchise and extend into what can be seen as more prestigious acting. And it cemented Michelle Yeoh as not only an Asian actress but also an important piece of American cinema,” he said. Samantha Thomas (CW ‘24) loved seeing Sarah Polley win for her adapted screenplay of Women Talking, but wished it got more Oscar love.  It has incredibly powerful performances that got zero attention from Rooney Mara, Jessie Buckley, Claire Foy — and I think that it’s a movie tackling such a difficult topic that typically in Hollywood is so exacerbated and exploitative. Also, the music was beautiful. The score heightens the experience of the movie and truly went out of its way to highlight the dread that these women feel, and I’m sad that it did not get nominated for Best Original Score,” she said. There was a sense of CSArts students being more passionate about movies this year, compared to last year. That was reflected in the ratings as well. Ratings jumped from last year’s Oscars by 12% compared to last year’s dismal ratings. Nearly 20 million people tuned in from everywhere, all at once, to celebrate cinema on the big screen. "

With over 100 million users worldwide within a week of its launch, nearing numbers that rival sites like Google and Youtube, it can feel like nearly everyone is on the edge of their seats asking - What’s next? To answer these concerns, we’ve asked for an exclusive interview with ChatGPT itself. Here it is: ChatGPT: Hello, CSArtisan! I’m happy to assist with your interview. Please feel free to ask me any questions you have. CSArtisan: With the immense rise in both educators and students using AI in school environments, a number of concerns have been raised about using AI to cheat. How would you respond to these types of concerns? ChatGPT: Concerns about using AI to cheat are understandable, but clear guidelines and policies can be put in place to prevent misuse of AI tools. Educators can make it clear to students that using AI to cheat is not acceptable, and students can be encouraged to use AI responsibly. AI can also be used to prevent cheating, such as through plagiarism detection software and AI-powered proctoring tools. Ultimately, it is up to everyone involved in the education system to ensure that AI is used in a responsible and ethical manner. CSArtisan: As both journalists and arts students at the CSArtisan, we understand the importance of human creativity. How do you respond to the idea of AI taking over both creative and practical jobs? ChatGPT: AI is unlikely to completely replace human creativity and practical skills, and is better used as a complement. AI can improve efficiency and productivity, but many tasks require human skills such as empathy, critical thinking, and problem-solving. A balance between AI and human workers can achieve greater results. CSArtisan: Thank you for your responses. Last question: What do you think about the idea of AI replacing search engines like Google and Bing? Do you think it’ll lead to a slippery slope where AI replaces all technology? ChatGPT: While AI could potentially replace search engines, it is unlikely to lead to a total replacement of all technology by AI. However, the increasing use of AI raises important questions about its impact on society, including concerns about harmful or discriminatory use and its impact on employment. It is important to consider the benefits and risks of AI, and ensure its responsible and ethical development and use through regulation and ongoing discussions. CSArtisan: Thank you so much for your time. Could you please say goodbye to our readers in a fun way? ChatGPT: Of course, it was my pleasure to chat with you all! Keep up the great work at CSArtisan, and don’t forget to sprinkle a little bit of creativity into everything you do. Stay curious, stay imaginative, and stay inspired! Goodbye for now!

March 8th was the opening night for the 10th Grade Showcase where sophomores showcased their pieces from last semester in the front lobby for everyone to enjoy! The show consisted of various types of artworks from a multitude of classes. The show included master copy paintings that sophomores completed in the 2D Design class. Students were able to display their knowledge and create their own rendition of other master painters. The show also contained a few pieces from other classes like photography and ceramics. Overall, the showcase was a great opportunity to celebrate their work in a space with their family and friends. Here is what a few Visual Arts students had to say about their experience with the show:  This was my first time being a part of a CSArts visual arts showcase! It was so much fun and exciting to have my artwork be appreciated by everyone. It was a great showcase and I am excited for next year!” Alina Ayala (VA ‘25)  It was very inspiring to see my fellow peers use their skills to create something beautiful and new. ” Monze Aquino (IA ‘25)  My experience with the showcase was a bit nerve wracking because other people’s paintings and photographs were really good. So, I felt a bit down because I thought mine wasn’t good enough but then I realized that we are all different in our levels of artist and that mine was good because I worked hard. I could tell that everyone also worked hard and I think that is what counts as an artist and that is what is going to make other’s experience the showcase” Nayeli Gutierrez (VA ‘25). As always, the Visual Arts conservatory did a spectacular job, but this specific showcase was even more special. For the first time ever, visual arts students from the Exhibition and Design class worked behind the scenes to help the show come to life. From marketing, curating, decorating, and organizing, the visual arts students worked alongside each other to make the show possible. We asked a couple students who worked on the show about their experience.  It was definitely a great experience since I’ve never created/designed a showcase before. It was challenging but my group was great and we had little trouble deciding the details. My favorite part of the showcase is definitely the center area where the ceramic pieces are shown! I also really loved the sign for the 10th grade showcase on the main wall!” says the team’s curator, Alisa Kang (VA ‘24).  Working on the showcase was really fun! It was a great experience to collaborate with a team and create that setup. My favorite part of the showcase was probably the centerpiece with the curtains. It was cool to put it up and really show off and frame those pieces,” says the team’s Director of Marketing, Dyllan Edge (VA ‘25)  Even though it took a lot of work and brainstorming, it was a lot of fun working on the showcase! We had to work from scratch, figuring out the theme we wanted, purchasing the items we needed, and contacting the teachers to collect artworks as well. We also had a deadline to meet, so it was even more pressuring. Although all the sweats and tears went into each individual tacky used to put up the paintings, the exhibition turned out wonderful! I learned how to work better as a team and problem-solve on the way, so the experience was worth it as well! My favorite part of the showcase was the main wall! My teammate created a beautiful font and I worked on laying out the paintings. I thought it turned out to be a very effortlessly perfect type of effect and I liked that a lot!” says the team’s client relations, Han Lam (VA ‘24) "

    "body": "2023/02/27 - Between the kisses and candy hearts, Valentine’s Day is a celebration of the patron saint of beekeepers, epilepsy, and of course, lovers. Valentine’s Day is a commemoration of the bravery of a man who dedicated his life to nurturing and strengthening the love two people have for one another. The origin of Valentine’s Day began in Rome during the reign of Emperor Claudius the Cruel. Under the Emperor’s iron fist, Rome necessitated a powerful army. However, young soldiers were more focused on dedicating themselves to their families, leaving Emperor Claudius’s military severely lacking. To combat the problem, Claudius decided to ban all marriages and engagements in Rome, catching the attention of a Roman priest by the name of Valentine. Valentine determined that forbidding rituals of love was a devious act, and retaliated against the Emperor in secret. The priest bravely continued to marry young lovers in spite of the Empire’s decrees until he was caught in 270 CE. When Valentine was discovered, he was beaten and beheaded on February 14, becoming a martyr and saint within the Christian church. Valentine’s martyrdom is a symbol of persisting and uplifting love in the face of all odds, and if not for his bravery and values, the candy hearts and chocolate roses would be a slice of imagination. Valentine’s Day is not only a couples holiday, but rather a celebration of all love—whether romantic, platonic, familial, or even artistic. The Day of Love is a reminder to us all to uplift ourselves and each other, in spite of any obstacles that may stand in our way. "

On February 4th, CSArts students gathered together to dance with their friends at Winter Formal, held at the Springfield Banquet Hall. The theme of the night was Enchanted Evening, and many dressed in their finest dresses and suits, some with florals, lace, and greens and purples to match the theme.  “For this year’s winter formal theme, we wanted to go for a fantasy vibe, something that was really different from homecoming, Neon Nights. The venue had a whimsical feel and the potential to portray a fairytale scene. ” Jolene Young said, one of the members of the CSArts Leadership dance committee. During the dance, the venue was decorated with a variety of fairy lights, flowers and vines, helping to create a truly ethereal atmosphere to the event. However, despite the beautiful decorations, some were apprehensive of attending the event at first.  “I was kind of worried about distance and finding people to spend time with, but that ended up not being a problem at all. I’m glad I went!” said Rosie Williams (VA ‘23) When asked about the process of choosing a venue, the dance committee said, “all venues are chosen prior to the school year by the leadership advisor. For these venues, the advisor looks at the venue capacity and having various spaces to accommodate all students. We also take into account the location, finding a place in the middle ground. ” No matter the distance or theme, all that were at Winter Formal can confirm that it was truly an enchanted evening to remember.

Three weeks after its release, the show has already surpassed “Dahmer,” for Netflix’s second most popular English-language series of all time and has amassed a staggering billions’ hours worth of views. A coming-of-age, murder-mystery, comedy with a supernatural twist, offers something for everyone to enjoy. However, Jenna Ortega’s masterful portrayal of this protagonist’s snappy comebacks, edgy personality, and dogged pursuit of the truth is what truly has fans obsessed. “The enduring appeal of characters like this – an admittedly toxic outcast with inherently good intentions – is the desire for every weirdo to feel seen on TV,” writes critic Janelle Zara in How Netflix’s Wednesday became a pop culture phenomenon. On the surface, “Wednesday,” seems like your typical teenage mystery spin off– the kind that Netflix has attempted with “Riverdale,” an adaptation of the Archie Comics or the “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. ” But underneath, there is a compelling coming-of-age story about learning to take responsibility for one’s actions and their effects on others. As Wednesday navigates through this mystery and her new school, she is also tasked with the teenage task of repairing the damage she’s done to her relationships. Tim Burton’s “Wednesday,” is undoubtedly one of the best series to premiere this year, and it is wholly deserving of that title. "

This December, the holidays have consumed our campus with a wide array of different holiday food and desserts. The celebrations of the holidays include: Kwanzaa, Christmas, Hanukkah, Feast of Our Lady Guadalupe, Boxing Day, Omisoka, and New Years (plus many more). All of these holidays celebrate collective important themes of love, family and unity through the gift of culture, representation and food. Furthermore, eating a traditional dinner unites families through their historical and cultural foods. Food is a way to bring people together through cultures and old family recipes. The CSArtisan wants to share students’ family recipes through this holiday season! Reina Sato, a 7th grader from CSARTS shared her favorite Japanese and Mexican traditional foods she enjoys this holiday season.  I love having mixed cultures. My mother is Mexican American and my father is Japanese American. Thanksgiving and Christmas are our favorite holidays. My favorite dish to eat at the Thanksgiving table is Takoraisu Mexican and Japanese fusion tacos. ” Takoraisu is prepared by combining tacos and rice to create a delicious marriage of two culinary favorites and end up with something so unique and delicious. Taco rice truly embodies fusion cuisine. What makes taco rice Japanese is that, aside from the Tex-Mex flavor, mirin, sake, and soy sauce are added. This gives it the extra flavor that makes Takoraisu even tastier. Sometimes it can be served with rice in a tortilla roll. Another variant of the dish is called “taco rice ball” where all the usual ingredients like meat, rice, and cheese are combined, dipped in batter, deep fried then served with salsa or tomato ketchup. Reina Sato is only one of the many diverse students on this campus another student who shares multi-cultural heritage is Malik Brown, who shares his Nigerian-Dutch American fusion foods he shares with his family on christmas,  On Christmas my father makes kibbeling It’s deep fried battered fish, sprinkled with spices and usually served with sauces, like garlic sauce. And if you like oily food with lots of meat and fish which is from the Dutch, too. ” Kibbling is an important family tradition for Malik, sharing that with his family brings him,  It brings me so much joy to sit around the dinner table and share these pepprey well seasoned treats with my siblings. ” Sharing these recipes shows the amazing diversity on campus, bringing inclusivity and joy around every dinner table.

Asmik Yaghisjian, the kitchen manager, says she cooks breakfast with only the help of her assistant, Norma. Then, other kitchen staff arries, and they prepare for their busiest time of the day: lunchtime. Most of the food is made from scratch in the kitchen.  Some of them I create, others I just use recipes from my culture,” Yaghisijian said. Just this week, when the temperatures got cold, the CSArts kitchen staff made homemade pozole!  This food is downright gourmet, and definitely better than any other school food I’ve had. We are so lucky to have the wonderful cooks here at our school,” said Mr. Turf.

I used to make a bunch of different food, but now it’s almost all the same, we have the same salad bar and hot food. Only the Thanksgiving food is different. ” Yaghisijian says.

Endelman Secretly in The PnD Conservatory?: Look out for Dr. Endelman hiding in the shadows at your next CSArts performance! When asked which conservatory he would be in, Endelman says he’s always been a PnD kid at heart. As a self appointed power-tool lover, he wishes he could learn more about set building, stage lighting, and sound systems. (Any PnD students want to take him up on the offer?) Dr. Endelman Before The Fame: Before his rise to fame as the CSArts principal, Endelman was just like the rest of us. He took bowling as a class in his high school and, after graduation, secured a job at his local Burger King, where he was voted, “Employee of the Month. ” What Does Endelman Do Off The Clock?: Despite working at an arts school, Dr. Endelman described one of his favorite hobbies as sports! He admires all aspects of the activity– playing, coaching, and watching. As a nature-lover, he loves being outdoors and can be found camping and hiking on the weekends. Dr. Endelman No Uvula??: Perhaps the most shocking portion of this whole interview, it was learned that Dr. Endelman has no uvula. As to why and how, we did not have the time in the interview to discuss. But, next time you pass him in the hall, feel free to press him a bit about this fun fact. And of course, be sure to have him say “ahhh” so you can confirm this for yourself. What Makes The Endelman Wheels Turn?: On a more serious note, we also talked about Dr. Endelman’s identity and what inspires his everyday life. Based on a recently-taken “strength-based” assignment, Dr. Endelman describes himself as a coach, analyst, self-believer, catalyst, and Philomath (a lover of learning). He gets his inspiration from his students (woohoo!), family, mentors, music, learning, leadership, and coaching. Most Importantly, Is Dr. Endelman A Back, Side, or Stomach Sleeper?: To this question he answered with a simple sentence– no fluff, no nonsense– and I quote, “I start on my back and end up on my side. ” Do with that information what you will, CSArts. In all seriousness, thank you Dr. Endelman for your participation in this interview. And thank you, reader, for taking the time to learn a little bit more about your principal. "

    "body": "2022/12/16 - Holidays are a time to celebrate with family, but for some, it can be miserable. In this divisive time of Covid, politics, and religion, spending time with relatives can be too difficult. As a result of this division, comes a new way of celebrating the holidays, with the idea of, “family of choice. ” A family of choice can be anyone that you desire, as long as you feel comfortable and understood with those people. It can range from friends, coworkers, and neighbors. People who love you for your authentic self, and don’t expect you to change when you are around them. The importance of a found family is the fact that it can be between anyone, whether bound by blood or not. Many people choose to celebrate the holidays with their families of choice, for a variety of reasons. Some merely find it easier to celebrate with those already living close to them, and find the trip back home tedious and far too time-consuming. Others find their families of choice more understanding than the family they are actually related to. There’s less argument due to generational differences, and more understanding and compassion. The family of choice already accepts you for who you are, while some biological families may not, especially with older relatives.  Family of choice has been of great importance to the LGBTQ+ community. Many times, our queer siblings have been shut out or mistreated by family members. So, this idea has helped bring people together, who may have been shunned by family members,” said Mr. Blair, a Creative Writing teacher here at CSArts. With the rise of mental-health awareness, families of choice only become more important. People would rather spend time with those who don’t affect their mental health negatively, regardless of relation. It’s hard to connect with those who won’t connect with you, which many feel when being around their extended family. An intense family gathering is not the recipe for feeling good about the holidays, and can put a damper on what is meant to be a joyful time. However, with the gift of choice, holiday celebrations don’t have to feel this way. There’s no need for time with those you love to be weighed down by obligation and formality. Instead, people have the opportunity for new ways of celebrating, beginning new traditions on their own terms. Through a family of choice, people are allowed to make the holidays truly their own. The core of the holidays has always been to spend time with those you love, celebrating the love and care you give for each other. No matter who you spend the holidays with, it should always be with someone that will make you smile. "

    "title": "Crazy Christmas Movie Conundrum",
    "body": "2022/12/16 - Now that December has rolled around the holiday season is in full swing. Which means people are busting out the decade old Christmas DVDs and settling down on their couch to watch iconic Christmas movies such as “Home Alone” or “A Christmas Story”. But then there are the more contraversial choices. Movies that walk a thin line between actual Christmas movies or movies that were just released during the holiday season. These movies spark the age old debate of what qualifies as a Christmas movie? Every month, student journalists at the CSArtisan get together and have a news meeting. We go over the news of the month, upcoming holidays, etc. all to figure out what’s gonna be our next headlining stories for the next issue. When I brought up this story I got some quizzical looks about what this article would be about. But when I brought up Die Hard as an example of a “Christmas Movie”… The whole room erupted into argument! “It’s not a Christmas movie!” exclaimed our journalist M. J. , “It just happens to take place on Christmas Day the plot doesn’t revolve around Christmas!” Though the beginning of the movie centers around Bruce Willis going to L. A. for his kid’s Christmas and getting roped up in his ex-wife’s office Christmas party, once the terrorist plot starts up you completely forget the Christmas parts of the movie. Sidney, our graphic designer, had a different opinion, “It’s a Christmas movie because the idea surrounding it is that it’s set during Christmas so it should be regarded as a Christmas movie,” And, as said previously, the plot does get kicked into motion by the terrorists hijacking the office Christmas party. Also, a lot of the trailers and promos about Die Hard really double down on the fact Die Hard is a Christmas movie I left the meeting feeling optimistic about this article. If even a throwaway mention of Die Hard sparked so much debate, I wondered what students thought of other infamous not-so-Christmas movies. So I set up a google form, to gauge what people classified as a Christmas movie. What I was expecting when sending out the Google form was maybe some lukewarm takes about Die Hard or the Nightmare Before Christmas. What I didn’t expect was people saying HOME ALONE (technically) ISN’T A CHRISTMAS MOVIE. “There’s a difference between a story set in Christmas and a Christmas story,” says Alex the Christmas heretic,  Sure, movies like Home Alone take place during Christmas, and are the reason for events to happen, they are not part of the real story. Christmas stories are about Christmas itself, and the values we associate with the holidays like family connection, thoughtfulness and giving. Therefore, movies set during Christmas but with no message or story connecting to Christmas values doesn’t fall under ‘A Christmas Story’ movie. ” Despite how controversal Alex’s opinion is, I can see his point. Once the kid is left behind in house the Christmas aspect of the movie takes a backseat outside of Kevin’s clever traps using Christmas items. But even with the Christmas themed trappings he was just using what he could find around the house! I’d say the one thing against Alex’s argument is that the plot is set in motion by the family Christmas trip to France. If the family wasn’t going to France they probably would’ve waited out the power outage and had a regular Christmas at home. The other thing I realized is how much this Home Alone argument echoed arguments about Die Hard. Both movies are centered around Christmas at the very beginning and the very end but the middle of the movie has next to nothing to do with Christmas! This is why I wanted to center an article around this topic. It so interesting to see people go into spirited fights over Christmas movies like they bet their life on this movie. It’s also fun to fight over things they don’t really matter! Especially with the world we live in nowadays. "

    "body": "2022/12/16 - CSArts Conservatories invite all students to explore their passions, to search for a good fit with their interests and talents. Sometimes, that means switching conservatories. Dozens of CSArts students plan on transferring conservatories next Fall. This month, many students have prepared and submitted their transfer applications, and CSArts believes there is no shame in finding a better fit.  Generally, students switch conservatories because they have become immersed in the artistic culture of the school and have found other areas that interest them more,” said Dr. Cook, the Dean of Arts. Students may also wish to advance in specific subjects, like ballet or painting, and choose their new conservatory accordingly.  The benefit for transferring to another conservatory would be to focus on another art form that has become a new artistic passion,” said school counselor Mrs. Shiroma. CSArts students are surrounded by a wide variety of forms of art and opportunities every day.  I have friends in different conservatories. I think that gave me a perspective of what it would be like in another conservatory, and of the other possibilities at CSArts,” said Sienna (IA ‘26). Those changing conservatories could also have experienced a change of interests. On the other hand, some wish to pursue their current or original interests.  My interests haven’t really changed, but talking to other people, I’ve realized that where I want to be is not where I am now,” said Sienna. Some students, especially freshmen, are switching from Integrated Arts to other conservatories.  I think the classes in other conservatories are more leveled than the classes in IA,” said an anonymous student.  In IA you start with beginner classes in lots of different subjects. ” Many see the Integrated Arts conservatory as a great opportunity to experience all that CSArts has to offer. Those transferring from IA choose the art form they connect with the most.  Visual Arts seems pretty cool,” said Sophia, a freshman currently in Creative Writing.  I draw a lot during class to help me focus and pay attention to my teachers, so I should probably be in a drawing conservatory!” Student applications were accepted until December 9th. Though the due date has passed, those wishing to change conservatories can still apply at the beginning of next school year.  Current CSArts-SGV students are welcome to apply for a conservatory transfer once per school year,” said Mrs. Shiroma.  Current students wishing to apply to a new conservatory must submit a complete conservatory transfer application and participate in a new conservatory placement activity. ” High school is the perfect time to explore your interests. Better now than half-way into your career! "

    "body": "2022/12/16 - When imagining a professional conference, one usually pictures executives talking jargon in their crisp power suits of navy-blue and perfectly polished shoes, examining graphs and statistics of some really important things. But at this conference, there are no stoic business associates discussing forecasts and analyses. Instead, I see eclectic fashion, colorful glasses, big tote bags, and warm smiles. This, is the American Art Therapy Association’s (AATA) annual conference. But what is art therapy? According to AATA, “Art therapy is an integrative mental health and human services profession that enriches the lives of individuals, families, and communities through active artmaking, creative process, applied psychological theory, and human experience within a psychotherapeutic relationship. ” That’s a lot, but it essentially means that art can heal everyone. Mid-November, I had the opportunity of attending AATA’s 53rd annual conference in Minneapolis. As a student who attends an art high school, exploring different art careers alongside my peers can be challenging. I interviewed various successful art therapists at the conference asking what their journey was like to gain inspiration for not only myself, but for other interested creative minds. So, what are some of the paths towards art therapy? Professor Maria Riccardi who teaches at Concordia University in Canada said she was a curious and good student in high school.  I was Italian so I had a strict family, so I always had to have better grades and there was a lot of pressure… But yes I was art focused. I used to draw in everything I had, I took the art classes, and I started to really like it a lot. ” Professor Joyce Yip Green, an assistant professor at Loyola Marymount University’s Department of Marital and Family Therapy/Art Therapy also shared what her high school experience was like. “I was a nerd, a straight-A student. But I was also really involved in different clubs on campus like Key Club and Yearbook Staff. I was an art focused person so that’s why I joined Yearbook Staff and the year I was the editor, our yearbook was nominated for best design. ” However, despite being passionate about the arts, Professor Green had no idea about the world of art therapy until she was in college, “One of my mentors told me that there was a master’s degree in art therapy…They encouraged me to go to grad school to study art therapy because I was a psychology and studio art major. ” Like Professor Green, Professor Lisa D. Hinz, director of the art therapy doctorate program at Dominican University of California, didn’t discover art therapy in high school either. “In high school, I was an overachiever. I worked hard and I got straight A’s. I discovered art therapy when I became a psychologist. I had a PhD in clinical psychology and my first job was at the counseling center. ” At the center, Professor Hinz gave college counseling and one day, volunteered to supervise an art therapy student. When observing the art therapy sessions, she was in awe of the process.  Everything I saw was so powerful. Because there’s a visual record, it doesn’t always have to involve so many words, and it was just - profound,” said Professor Hinz. On the other hand, Amanda Power who specializes in children and adolescents, tells a different story of her high school years. “I was kind of flying under the radar a little bit, school didn’t come super easy to me, but I worked pretty hard. I had some good teachers who helped guide me along the way and that was super helpful. Definitely not straight-A’s by any means but I managed to do okay,” Ms. Power said. However, like the rest, she had never heard of art therapy until her later years in life. “I was really confused about what I wanted to do after graduating high school and I ended up starting university… but I followed my passion to go back to art school. When I was there, I had an amazing art history teacher who talked about art therapy…I thought it was such a cool idea because I always wanted to work in the arts and with people…I was always trying to do some other thing and it always led me back to art therapy!” Finally, out of everyone I interviewed, Megan VanMeter who uses art therapy for burnout treatment was the only individual who discovered art therapy in high school,  I was a very good student. I was motivated, took my grades seriously, and knew I was heading to college. People were telling me all my life to be an artist so I didn’t want to be one. But when I was 13 I realized that I’m going to have to choose something so I guess I’ll do art. But I wasn’t convinced. When I was 15, I took the PSAT and checked the box saying I was interested in art careers and I got emails from college programs mentioning art therapy. And it just clicked in my head!…How wonderful to help people discover themselves through themselves. ” All of these people discovered art therapy in a serendipitous way. Through that one happen-chance, they all lept at the opportunity to help others heal through art. As Professor Hinz said, “I think it shows that it’s really powerful if you are a person who values art. ” With this knowledge, as students of CSArts, we can bring kindness and love to others through art.

It can affect anyone, but, statistically, it is more common for those in their 20’s and 30’s. The combination of weather changes, less sunshine, and the onslaught of homework can affect students, even here in “sunny” California.  I just end up feeling really depressed and I find it really difficult to get any work done. Then I end up feeling guilty, because I am not being productive,” said an anonymous CSArts student. This is not an uncommon occurrence of SAD and the slew of work students have during this time of year. Although SAD is common, there are ways to help those who are affected by it. Doctors encourage those with seasonal depression to make sure they are getting exercise, outside, if the sun is shining. Sun provides us with Vitamin D as well. In the winter, it may be difficult to get enough vitamin D, so doctors suggest vitamin supplements. Wide spectrum lights simulate sunlight by using special light bulbs and can also make quite a difference. They can be found on Amazon.

The story was great, but it seems that it would be better off being a mini series, rather than a movie. "

    "body": "2022/11/15 - The scary season is over, but the Halloween spirit is still haunting CSArts. Halloween was celebrated with the school’s first ever cross-conservatory haunted house: Tick or Treat! Students from the Acting, Creative Writing, Production and Design, and School of Dance conservatories collaborated to create an immersive experience.  The shows themselves were completely written, directed, musicalized, designed, built, and performed by CSArts students,” said Mr. Blaylock, the Creative Writing director. Each student brought their unique insight and talents to the event. Students were assigned different roles for the separate shows.  The writers wrote the script… The actors memorize their lines, and the production designers come up with a floor plan and design. There were people who did lights and people who did sound,” said Sophia (CW’26).  Each group [of students] contained a writing team, production and design team, and a performance team. Each group was given a dance studio to create an immersive theatrical experience inspired by Edgar Allan Poe’s The Devil in the Belfry,” said Mr. Blaylock. Jonas, a freshman, worked as one of five script writers and as a sound director for the shows.  It was a really fun experience… it was amazing to see what the actors and production and design crew put together based on our ideas,” he said. The design and construction stretched over the span of three days.  The students began creating the shows on Friday evening with the performance on Sunday night,” said Mr. Blaylock. On the weekend of the event, students planned, wrote, and rehearsed the shows. Though the students had limited time to prepare the event, they succeeded in creating four chilling Halloween stories. On October 23rd, CSArts presented four haunting shows in the dance studios.  I was really impressed with how much work they finished in two days, the sets especially. It was really entertaining! I was impressed by the cool use of music. One of them had someone actually playing the piano, another had a laugh track whenever they made a sit-com joke. One of them had a dance portion. I thought that was just awesome!” said Jaya, a student who attended the haunted house. Tick or Treat was an all around eerie production that showcased the talent and creativity of CSArts students.  The shows were spooky and disturbing while maintaining a great balance of comedy and cleverness. The students really stepped up to the difficult task of creating compelling stories in 48 hours. And the audience seemed to really enjoy what they came up with!” said Mr. Blaylock. Those who worked on the project agree.  It was really fun! I hope they do it again next year,” said Sophia. Hopefully, CSArts will host another scarily successful haunted house next Halloween. "

    "body": "2022/11/15 - Wedding bells rang, wedding bells chimed. In case you missed it, the Musical Theater Conservatory put on an early fall production of The Drowsy Chaperone. The show opened with a charming old man playing a record that ushered in a heartfelt comedy, titled The Drowsy Chaperone, about a beautiful actress quitting the glitz and glamour of show business to marry the man of her dreams. Behind the red curtain and bright lights, the relationships between the actors and their characters set the stage for a successful run. Many of the actors took it upon themselves to research their characters thoroughly in their own ways. Sawyer Valin (MT ‘23), who played The Man in the Chair, even contacted the actor who played his role in the original production of the show, Bob Martin, to flesh out his character as much as possible. Jolie Wang (MT ‘23), who played Mrs. Tottendale, the bubbly socialite with an enthusiasm for weddings, watched different videos of her Drowsy character.  I built my version of Mrs. Tottendale out of [the videos]. I sort of pieced together bits of all the Mrs. Tottendales I watched,” said Wang. Though the show’s run at CSArts has come to an end, the cast of The Drowsy Chaperone will remember the family they formed and the lessons they learned through rehearsing, performing, and embracing the show.  You have so much more freedom and possibility as an actor when you are diligent with your character breakdown work, supportive of every member of your cast, production team, and crew, and consistently eager to learn about the show itself and the exciting process of putting on a show,” Tara Moran (MT ‘23), who played Janet van de Graff, said. Students learned to dedicate themselves to their roles thoroughly and make the most of their rehearsal time to produce a masterful performance for everyone to enjoy. The Drowsy Chaperone was the semester’s first performance, kicking off the new school year with comedy, music, and a reminder of what CSArts truly values: celebrating and honoring art as a community.

However, many left the theaters unimpressed. Twitter wars popped up all over the web with conflicting opinions on the film. After scrolling through countless comment sections, I decided it was time for me to settle this myself. Told through the eyes of a psychiatrist, who never recovered from her own past traumas, Dr. Rose Cotter starts experiencing a supernatural phenomenon she can’t explain. This film’s plot dealt with complex topics of mental health intertwined with the enthralling twists and turns of a modern horror film. Throughout the movie, the smiling faces do not lose their gut-wrenching horror and kept me on my toes. However, despite the thrilling jumpscares, certain aspects did fall a flat. The villain of the story was not outside of the ordinary horror genre and many agree that the ending felt a bit cliche and left much to be desired. This is not to say that I didn’t enjoy it. With the chilling visuals and uneasy tension, this movie is a great way to scratch a horror film itch. "

However, with the rise of assignments and homework, it has grown to be an afterthought, something that is much more optional. With that being said, it is still a prominent part of students’ lives. Makeup, is also an outlet and an expression that crosses differen subcultures and factions becoming an ionic and recognizable feature. Sophomore Levvy Butler says makeup started out as a way for them to fit in. They say they lacked the technique and skill, but are getting more comfortable experimenting with different eyeliner shapes and colors.  So now, I wear makeup because I like the way it looks, and not because I want to look older or fit in or anything. ” Junior, Violet Zeug, says she wears makeup for a different reason. Makeup is less of a routine and more something she uses to improve how she feels. “I guess it’s some kind of insecurity, as far as feeling the need to be prettier/looking nicer/put together. ” For her, makeup is a tool, to improve her day and to make her feel prettier. Not only that, but it also goes with what she plans to wear. For example, when she wears her leather jacket, she’ll wear thick eyeliner, but for a more laid back look, she uses thinner and much more breezy eyeliner. An anonymous student said that for her, makeup is both therapeutic and creative. “It allows me to vent, and paint my emotions on my face, whether that means large pigmented red and black eyeliner, or soft green, and blue eyeshadow. ”Makeup is a creative outlet for her, one that has taken a lot of practice. “I find that there is no other form that allows me to be as creative and free as makeup does. ” Each student uses makeup with different goals in mind. For some it is artistry. For others, it is to fit in, or put on a protective mask. If you are interested in learning more about the world of makeup check out these artists!

It began with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, which is celebrated every year on November 1st. It marks the day when the land of the living and dead merge. Sacrifices are made to deities and people put on costumes made out of animal skins. When the Romans conquered the Celts, the tradition was adopted, but celebrations began early on October 31st. After influence from Christianity, the celebration’s name was changed to “All Hallows,” eventually turning into “Halloween. ” "

The club put up an ofrenda, an altar, in the cafeteria, as well as an árbol de vida (tree of life) outside. Students brought pictures of their loved ones, pets, flowers, and more to help decorate the ofrenda, and wrote the names of their loved ones on the árbol de vida. Dia de los Muertos, also known as the Day of the Dead, is a Latin holiday celebrated during the first two days of November. People gather together in homes, churches, and cemeteries to honor their deceased loved ones, bringing the dead’s favorite foods, drinks, and other mementos to celebrate. Originating as an Aztec holiday, Dia de los Muertos used to be a celebration of Aztec goddess Mictecacihuatl. The celebration would last an entire month, where it embraced the inevitability of death rather than fearing it. At present day, Dia de los Muertos is celebrated by many Latin cultures, and food is at the heart of the celebrations. Some decorations commonly featured treats in these ofrendas, are sugar skulls, pan de muerto (bread of the dead), fruit, and drinks. Yellow flowers are also everywhere. Typically, the flowers are yellow marigolds also known as “the flower of the dead. ” They are used to communicate with the souls and illuminate their path in finding their way home through the petals. Despite loss, ultimately Dia de los Muertos is a timeless celebration of the lives and memories of loved ones. "

    "title": "Audience Experience",
    "body": "2022/11/15 - On Sunday, October 28th, CSArts students were challenged to create four immersive, bone-chilling, cross-conservatory haunted house experiences. Participants were separated into four separate groups and each given one of the Dance Studios to use as their set. They toiled tirelessly over the course of two days to generate an entire production completely from scratch– writing a script, building a set, designing costumes, and memorizing lines. I had the fortunate opportunity to attend this event, and I’m sure even the staunchest critics can attest: every participants’ efforts paid off in the most spectacularly scary way. The first room I entered was called “Burning Hour. ” The audience arranged similar to a play; only we were all on the stage, rather than watching from the comfort of our seats. A well-dressed man muttering into his pocket watch walked us in, muttering, dragging his feet up the ramp. Inside, the scene began with a panicked warning made by a weeping woman, begging us to leave while we could. Then the scene shifted to pure horror. The Devil appeared standing above the woman’s husband, “tying” him to a clock painted on the floor. The woman pleaded for mercy, but she did it in vain. The Devil killed him and laughed madly! The audience was then ushered out. I was really impressed with the actors in this room, more than anything. The actors had limited props and time to memorize their roles, yet managed to portray desperation, pain, and anguish in a way that was deeply horrifying and resonated with the audience. The second room we walked through was titled “Initiation Institution. ” A group of white-masked cultists were searching for a new member amongst the audience. We were guided inside by a partially masked cultist and introduced to a room filled with white cloth-clad tables and chairs. They chose members in the audience to “compete,” in the ritual, a game of (rather aggressive) musical chairs. Then, the winner was given a mask. At the end of the ritual, the audience member replaced the tour guide’s seat. I was really amused by the way in which the cultists included the audience in this room, and the light touches of humor in the story. However, my favorite part of this room wasn’t the participation, it was the piano. Throughout the narrative, one of the cultists played a huge grand piano, and I just found that fact so charming. It was really the coolest detail, one that really added another dimension of horror to the already creepy plot. The third room was called “Home Is Where the Heart Is. ” We were welcomed into a large dining room by a loving family who was serving “something special” for dinner. Throughout the meal, it became more and more apparent to the audience that they were eating a human heart. Admittedly, this room was my favorite. This room weaponized music and sound in a deeply unsettling way. They would play this laugh track every time a character made a joke, which sort of added to the horror of it all. At the end, they played “We’ll Meet Again,” which left the audience morbidly fascinated. It was truly a spectacular performance. The fourth room, “Out of Tune,” was another story that used music to frighten. The plot centered around a classroom filled with badly behaved students and their strict new teacher with an unrealistic set of rules. As the plot progresses the teacher revealed himself to be obsessed with uniformity, even demanding students to wear the same hair style at one point. However, as the students began to rebel, the teacher possessed them and forced them to dance, like puppets to a puppet master. I really loved the addition of dancing in this story. It added an entirely new dimension to the narrative and really completed it. I loved the look of it as well, this room had the most concrete set design, with a real whiteboard, desks, and even books all over the walls. I thought this was a nice touch. Overall, I thought that this year’s eerie take on the haunted house was well worth the praise. I’m anxious to see what terrifying torments our school has in store next year. "

As my highschool years dawned on me, my excitement for college, my drive, and motivation suddenly fell. I was confused about who I was and who I was supposed to be. Losing myself, becoming lost in my own intrusive thoughts, quarantine created an escape for me and a lot of teens my age. I grew into a different person completely, as others matured and others stayed the same. But one thing we all had in common was we still felt like underclassmen; we still had time to make mistakes. Though when I look on my roster, we are all almost out of here. Now, as a senior, I find myself lost in the abyss of modern day high school. Going back to the beginning days in this school, CSArts San Gabriel Valley, I spoke with students who have been attending since 7th grade. They talked about their sadness in watching their classmates starting, and even harder, leaving. Their peers who have stayed at CSArts through the years have created a familial bond with each other, as they all watched each other grow and change through the traumatic events that came with the pandemic.  Even the bad memories and toxic friendships seemed to be missed, as once was recent, is now just childhood memories, seeing peers going in the wrong direction, or the right one, finds me stuck on where I have to go, I’m glad to have friends I consider family at CSArts” one student said. Some seniors are facing the problem of going in the “wrong” direction. As we see in schools and news reports across the country, students are acting out and learning hard lessons with situations they should have learned during late middle school and early high school. The pandemic has stripped students of these lessons. I feel this generation of seniors does not have the same maturity as the seniors before the pandemic. Why would they? Parts of life and experiences have been stripped from us; they have led some of my peers on difficult paths. I hope as time progresses we get the experiences that we lost in the pandemic. "

Founded by two CSArts Juniors, the band Saint Ivy gives its takes on classics from The Beatles to the Pixies to Weezer. Over the summer, Eli Eisenberg, Chase Timmons, and Marcelo Alves assembled Saint Ivy, anxious to grow an audience and take advantage of their musical talents. Sadly, band member Marcleo decided to branch off from CSArts and transfer schools, but that didn’t stop the friends from putting together a thriving and extraordinary band. CSArts provided ample opportunities for the three boys to indulge in their common interests. Now, Chase, Eli, and Marcelo are climbing their way up the pyramid of student bands in their matching black suits and sunglasses, as well as the countless other bands in the LA area. The velvet tone of Marcelo’s voice and the captivating performances from the bassist and drummer do nothing but demonstrate the musical expertise the three boys have put countless hours into perfecting. The two currently-enrolled band members, Eli and Chase, graciously opened up about the lessons they have learned as students at an arts school. The bassist, Eli Eisenberg, talked a lot about “collaboration” and how it benefits the growth of their band outside of school. Chase also shared that the “music theory” their conservatory teachers ingrain in them is vital to improving their success as a band. Unfortunately, time management was, once again, a topic of discussion. It was one that highlighted the main struggle as a student of CSArts; there are not enough hours in the day. Thankfully, the band shares similar time frames in which they are able to practice. Eli said that weekends are the perfect time to get together. The two band members also expressed their gratitude for the practice rooms their teachers provide.  Mr. Broberg does a good job of making us play for our classmates,” Eli said. Their expertise shines through their performances and demonstrates how having the space to improve and perform benefits the band’s growth in “stage presence”. Finally, band members made a point to show their appreciation for the school’s support and the uplifting community that has surrounded them.  CSArts students are always there supporting us,” Eli said. School spirit has provided Saint Ivy with the confidence to continue their pursuit of growing their band.

It’s been bad for the last few years,” senior Eliza Kim, said. Creative Writing Conservatory instructor Mr. Blair says,  There is no quick fix. We have to be patient. The school’s in a tough spot. They can’t make more space because there’s not more space. They have to be creative. ” However, an effective solution to the parking problems is on the way.  We are going to be redesigning the campus at some point,” said Dr. Endelmen, CSArts principal. The “big picture,” is to build permanent classrooms to replace the current 400s buildings and dance studios. This will give necessary space to expand the parking lot, and install more parking spaces. The goal for the needed changes is set for completion in the next 3 to 5 years. Last summer, the admin made new designations for student and teacher parking. Spots are numbered, and security has been tightened in order to make sure parking guidelines are being followed. Also, CSArts tried easing the parking pain by adding around 10 new spaces, but this still does not solve the bigger problem. It is not just a matter of too little space, it’s also a matter of behavior behind the wheel.  There are behaviors and norms that people can do to make things less bad,” Dr. Endelman says. He reports recurring problems with cars blocking the entrance to the lot, as well as cars parked in incorrect places. The principal encourages drivers to adhere to the signs, listen to directions from crossing guards, and pay attention to their surroundings. The CSArts community, with guidance from admin, is taking steps to finally end these pressing parking problems. "

Most of us know McCurdy from the iconic Nickelodeon shows such as “Sam and Cat” and “iCarly. ” McCurdy talks about how she had to try to grow from her childhood roles that she was forced into.  I yearn to know the people I love deeply and intimately—without context, without boxes—and I yearn for them to know me that way, too. ”  Jennette McCurdy, “I’m Glad My Mom Died”McCurdy’s memoir is a goodbye to her past struggles with various eating disorders, an abusive relationship with her mother, and her not-so-perfect child acting career. McCurdy tells her story that most were unaware of and were left to assume. McCurdy’s memoir is also filled with humor and finds light within the dark moments that she shares. She shares her experience as a child actress and the pressures that came with it. She also addresses the struggles she had with identity because the characters she played had become who people always saw her as. She gives the audience the insight on what she had gone through to get to the point she was able to write this book. This memoir doesn’t only focus on her hardships but guides us through the journey she had to go through to heal from them. The title of this memoir may be off putting for some, but in my opinion perfectly encapsulated McCurdy’s journey and relationship with her mother. I personally listened to the audiobook of this memoir, narrated by McCurdy herself and I think because of that, I enjoyed it significantly more. This book explores the toxic side of being a child actress in the early 2000’s, and what she went through emotionally because of that. One thing that stood out to me was when McCurdy was the sole provider for her family at age ten. The pressure in the environments she was in all throughout her life up until her mother’s death is written so unapologetically. From the outside looking in, the audience of her shows would’ve never known, such as the dynamic between the cast and the “creator”. There are so many instances where the theme of “there is more beneath the surface” occurs. This memoir sheds a new light for many fans with what happened to her in the entertainment industry, but is also a story of grief.  Maybe it’s because she didn’t want to be a dancer growing up, she wanted to be an actress, and maybe Mom only sits in when I’m being the thing she wanted to be. ”  Jennette McCurdy, “I’m Glad My Mom Died”If you or a loved one is experiencing or affected by a mental health, substance use, eating disorders or suicidal crisis, please call or text ‘988’ (or chat online on 988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline’s website) for free, confidential, and immediate help. : "

It doesn’t end there! The World Language department also hosted a film festival that showcased “Selena,” a film that tells the story of Selena Quintanilla’s life and the challenges she experienced as a Latina. Students have also taken action on social media to spread awareness and appreciation towards the Hispanic community.  I’ve seen people online doing things on the streets that are celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month. I have also seen many people online spreading resources to help hispanics and I have also participated in this through my social media platforms in the past,” said Alexa Vazquez (VA ’25).

    "body": "2022/10/13 - Breaking news, CSArts: due to the pandemic, our seniors are playing “catch-up” to college like never before. Just as the class of ‘23 was readjusting to in-person classes, they were hit with another massive challenge: college applications. The stressors of school, Covid, and mental health are already challenging. Conversations regarding the absence of motivation circulate among the student body as tensions rise with the upcoming applications.  I feel that quarantine had a huge impact on my work ethic. Before the pandemic, I would always be on top of my work. But after, I feel like my motivation began to slip,” senior Samantha Linares said. Junior year is usually known as the most academically challenging, but seniors say, the stress from senior year is even worse.  Honestly, I feel so unprepared. Junior year was doable but senior year brings on so much more stress due to college applications!” senior, Emma Smith said. In addition to these issues of motivation and workload, some students feel like Covid interfered with important experiences that would add to their applications and their high school experiences.  I feel unprepared to write my college essays and because I haven’t lived through enough high school, I feel,” senior Tess Bellman said. The reality is, most high school students’ careers have been spent behind a computer, and many feel that they do not have enough outside accomplishments to include in their essays and applications. "

    "title": "A Lesson In Horror",
    "body": "2022/10/13 - Most students at CSArts leave class with homework, but in creative writing, students leave with nightmares. Horror Fiction students, taught by Mr. Meden, spend their time reading and writing frightening short stories, and discuss and analyze the works from the great horror writers at the beginning of each class. The Horror Fiction class is currently working on a character-focused short piece. Michael Myers, Freddy Kruger, Jason, and Leatherface are prime examples of character-pieces with troubling and demented pasts.  Oftentimes the best horror stories have a main character that is uniquely vulnerable or uniquely suited to the spooky situation they’re in,” Mr. Meden said.  So I’m challenging students to try and write a story where their main character is the best possible character for their story. ” Many students are taking the piece head on, excited for the opportunity to let their nightmares get creative.  I’m writing a story about a human-sized spider, from the spider’s point of view,” said Ethan Marvil (CW ‘23). Students are also excited for the upcoming content in the class as Halloween creeps closer.  People are more in the mood to write spooky stuff! And I think it’d be fun if we did something for Halloween, like watch a spooky movie,” Griffin Stenzel (CW ‘24) said. Though the class isn’t diving into horror movies just yet, they have started reading bloody (literally) Halloween-themed short stories. So far, The October Game, by Ray Bradbury, is a class favorite. The short story follows partiers at a Halloween get-together playing a game of hot potato. The disturbing game does not reveal what’s inside the foil. We’ll just leave it to your imagination. But the class is not just about fun and fright. Mr. Meden uses these frightening stories as a way to introduce new skills to students.  I hope it was instructive to students on prepping a reveal in a narrative twist and how to get into the head of a really dark and horrifying character,” Mr. Meden said. Mr. Meden and students plan on digging deeper into the history of horror, during the second half of the semester, as well as detach from the Western Horror Canon to explore more diverse fiction, like as Indigenous and East Asian Horror.

    "body": "2022/10/13 - On October 4th, two fires broke out on the CSArts campus. The first fire was in the 100’s girls restroom, and was swiftly put out by a custodian. The resulting smoke of the first fire did not set off the fire alarms. The second fire, however, was set in the gender neutral restroom by the dance studio portables. This fire activated the alarms, and was put out by security. The school was safely evacuated during the conservatory, thanks to proper training of the CSArts staff. The Los Angeles County Fire Department arrived quickly to inspect the scenes of the incidents. Then, students were allowed to return to their normal operations and finish off their school day. At CSArts, student safety and security comes first, and CSArts administration is currently cooperating with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department with an open arson investigation, as well as their own internal investigation into the incident.  There is currently no update other than the investigation is active and ongoing,” CSArts admin said. If you have additional details to report about this incident, the CSArts administration encourages them to use the Text-A-Tip line, at 240-847-4483 or to email them at administration@sgv. csarts. net.

Teachers received an email from the CSArts administration, requiring seating charts for each class in order to track any new outbreaks and give more accurate information for those who may have been exposed to the virus. Earlier in September, President Joe Biden, in an interview with 60 Minutes, announced that the Covid pandemic was over. However, scientists, doctors, and some students at CSArts aren’t so sure.  I don’t think the pandemic is over because it is still affecting people. They are acting like it’s over and that is what causes the cases to get worse,” Senior Sofia Reyes said.  Covid is still a thing and there are still people who aren’t vaccinated. I do not believe that covid will ever be over, but I believe that it will die down,” Freshman Leaf Barnett said. Scientists urge caution in claiming that the Covid pandemic is over.  The pandemic is over. If you notice, no one’s wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape. ” President Biden said. The White House responded that Biden meant to express the fact that vaccines have proved to be useful, and that the virus is now more controlled. New updated boosters are now available, with Pfizer’s booster being cleared for those 12 and older. Moderna’s vaccine is cleared by the FDA for those 18 and over.

    "body": "2022/10/13 - CSArts students are getting a head start for college with two different options to earn college credit early. These two different avenues are Advanced Placement or “AP classes” and college classes on the CSArts campus from Citrus College, located in Glendora. But there are differences between the two options. The common avenue for credit is through AP classes. The Advanced Placement Course prepares students throughout the year to take the College Board Exams annually in May. Students pay to take the test for college credit. Exams are graded on a scale of 1-5. Most colleges will give credit for test scores of 3 and up. The positive aspect is that students can get a good grade in the class and fail the AP exam with no effect on the semester grade. Scores of 1 and 2 will not give you college credits, but do not affect grades on the transcripts.  I would say that the AP program does offer some advantages, especially for students not yet ready for the pace of an actual college class. A student does not have to take the AP exam in order to take an AP class and receive the letters AP on their transcript,” Mr. Turf, a CSArts AP World teacher said. Citrus College classes, however, directly affect a college transcript for high school students. In partnership with Citrus College, CSArts is able to host full blown college classes on campus! This cuts the college board out of the equation entirely and allows grades in the class to count directly to college credit. These courses also allow teachers freedom to go further in depth on topics because they are not preparing students for a national test. This means they can adjust accordingly if students are falling behind. But it is important to remember that this is a college class. It is rigorous and students will be graded like college students. This means deadlines and assignments come a lot harder and faster than they do in regular high school classes. So, missing one assignment can mean playing catch up for the rest of the semester. Combine that with the different grading system, it can definitely cause anxiety for students. In recent years, there has been a push by students and faculty to phase out A. P. classes. With exams such as the SAT’s no longer being required to apply to 4-year colleges and the $96 dollar price tag on the AP exams, students are gravitating towards Citrus College classes.  I am supportive of the moving away from A. P. classes because of the focus on the AP Exams,” Mr. Pegan, instructor for Citrus College U. S. History, said.  Particularly in the social sciences I’ve found that the A. P. Exams are not a perfect reflection of what a typical college level history class would have students complete. I also am mindful of the price associated with A. P. Exams. I think the push away from A. P. classes is driven both by a reflection on the value of courses for students and the role of an organization like the College Board in providing access to advanced courses. In addition, it is driven by fewer colleges accepting A. P. exam scores or placing more restrictions on their acceptance. ” CSArts may run into difficulty adding more Citrus College courses because the college requires more extensive education in order to instruct at the college level.  At CSArts-SGV, we have academic and conservatory staff that already hold a content-specific master’s degree (or equivalency at the approval of Citrus College) that enables them to teach at the community college level. Having a content-specific master’s degree is not common for educators working at the secondary level (high school). If CSArts-SGV were to entirely replace AP classes with Citrus College courses, then a teacher would have to at least have their master’s degree in that subject, earn content equivalency by Citrus College, or operate the class run by a Citrus College professor,” Mr. Turf said. The move towards getting college credit in high school is a popular goal; however, the road to get there is tough and grueling especially for secondary instructors. The goal in California is to provide students early and inexpensive college education as an investment into the state’s future. If you have more questions regarding college credit, guidance counselors or the A. P/CC students on campus will have more information on the best route for you! "

    "body": "2022/09/16 - As we dive into fall, the seniors of CSArts have a lot on their mind. College applications, scholarships, conservatory, and racing to be co-presidents of the class of 2023. We asked our new senior presidents about themselves and their feelings and plans for this coming school year: What inspires you and your leadership skills?: Bella Chang:  Being a good leader means putting yourself in uncomfortable positions where you can grow in confidence as a person and advocate for the people that you lead. I am always inspired by mentors and leaders I admire on campus, like Mr. Bowman and Ms. Kim. Tati Bovia:  I think our love for this school really motivates us to try and make it better! We want everyone to feel safe and happy in CSArts just like we have! Bella and I both love executing ideas and activities that help bring people together. Observing people and how they handle situations/looking at their wants and needs inspires me to be a better leader; learning how to calmly and kindly handle situations, disagreements, and as Bella said, being comfortable with being uncomfortable and being keen on problem solving. What are your main goals as class presidents?: Bella Chang:  Tati and I are beyond excited to make this senior year memorable for the Class of 2023, and that starts with unfailingly executing the plans/events we have set in place. Our main goals, outside of the traditional Senior Year activities, include “Memory Lane Day,” (bounce house, that rainbow parachute from P. E. with the handles, trampoline, etc. ), a Beach Bonfire day, drive-in movie night, and super awesome and wearable class merchandise. Tati Bovia:  Our goals are to have the best senior year ever! Something we have been super passionate about since we were class presidents our Junior year (2021-2022) was class bonding! Junior year was (almost) our full first year of high school and so we had almost a whole year of catching up and bonding to do. Bella and I love the Senior class as a whole and want to foster a healthy and happy environment for everyone to be good acquaintances! We plan on having multiple kinds of events people can attend (as Bella mentioned above), but we also really want to bring more acts of kindness around campus, like giving out flowers, leaving money in the vending machines for a random person and random notes of kindness! What do you bring to the table for CSArts that sets you apart from the rest?: Bella Chang:  Expertise and enthusiasm! We’ve shown up and shown out for these past three years of high school; there is no team more committed and spirited than the two of us. Tati Bovia:  I think a genuine love for this school! I’ve been at CSArts since it first opened, and it has been an amazing experience! Bella and I don’t just think we are capable of doing all of the planning and tasks it takes to run senior year; we WANT to do it. Bella and I find joy in planning these events and find even greater joy in seeing people enjoy them. That is not to say that the other candidates don’t love this school! Bella and I will do a lot for this school and will gladly sacrifice hours of our time and energy to make an amazing senior year happen. With a bright school year ahead, our senior class presidents are ensuring a variety of fun activities for our seniors to end their high school years on a high note. "

And on July 1st, millions flooded the theaters to enjoy the story of banana-loving, kung-fu learning, creatures fighting the Chinese Zodiac. The audience giggles at the ridiculous scenes before them, but what they don’t think about is the deeper meaning behind the over-use of Chinese culture in this film. “Minions: Rise of Gru,” grossed a whopping 869. 6 million USD yet despite the overbearing “Chinese concept,” just how many actual Chinese people did the cast feature? One. With, “Minions: Rise of Gru,” more than octupling the earnings of the Chinese casted, “Everything Everywhere All At Once”, one can’t help but wonder: “What about orientalism continues to sell more than the stories of authentic Asian experiences?” In, “Minions: Rise of Gru,” Chinese culture was polished down to the digestible concepts of dragons and kung-fu. On the other hand, “Everything Everywhere All At Once,” dealt with the hard issues of struggling with Asian American identity and the bittersweet familial ties that come with it. It is the hard topics like these that audiences wish to avoid whilst consuming media. But regardless, these are the topics that must be discussed when creating films with diverse casts. The stories of people of color will contain innate hardship and when these “un-entertaining” elements of cultural stories are avoided, a truly diverse story is lost. "

This is an example for students to understand that they have a voice in making our school more hospitable for all of us!” said an anonymous student. While students are pleased with the new additions to campus, the school has not put up much signage around the bathrooms.  There seems to be such a lack of advertising about this. We just have no idea where the bathrooms even are or that the studio bathrooms are even all-gender now. ” CSArts Administration says they mentioned the new bathroom designations during Welcome Week, and they are marked on campus maps.

Namika Conness and Riley Arce-Riolo are returning with a booming entrance into our school’s plethora of talented young artists. Their popularity is booming and blooming as Forsythia makes a name for themselves on campus. They had a busy Summer, filled with bustling gigs and playing parties around LA. Forsythia is seeking to expand its horizons and gain the audience of countless readily available teenagers. CSArts has provided fertile soil for them to succeed in the music business. Their talents have enabled them to enter the LA music scene with an electrifying stage presence, leaving the audience asking for more. Members of Forsythia are grateful for the opportunity to express and grow in their art form here at CSArts. Their experiences here have helped them grow as musicians and performers.  My conservatory, Musical Theater, has helped me become much more comfortable with performing and speaking in front of a crowd. ” Riley said. The well-rounded education of academics and arts has taught the duo valuable lessons about performing in the real world.  My teachers have taught me that connections are very important. ” Namika said. Yet, there is still more to consider. The band’s responses not only highlighted the skills that conservatory has provided them, they also resurfaced the annual struggle of time management as CSArts students.  Our school hours have definitely made it a lot more difficult to meet up and rehearse, especially since our drummer attends LACHSA and we have different school schedules. ” The band members said.  We have tried to rehearse on weekdays, but our longer school hours and far commutes to each other’s houses have made it tricky. ” Time management issues are not uncommon on this campus. Each student struggles to manage their daily tasks, social events, school work, and extracurriculars. Regardless, Forsythia chose to focus on the positive.  Attending CSArts has definitely been beneficial for our growth as a band and as artists… I’ve learned to have fun and just be in the moment because I’m doing what I love to do: performing and making music. ” As the long days grow longer and as we submerge into the school year once again, it’s important to stay positive and remember the privileges that come with being an arts student.  “[We are] constantly surrounded by like-minded individuals with similar passions, drive, and creativity. ” Forsythia said. The band’s take on the perks of enduring long school days is crucial to remember, but it is of utmost importance to go and support Forsythia!

    "body": "2022/09/16 - An underappreciated art form is finding new momentum at CSArts. New and returning students have likely noticed the colorful murals depicting diversity, creativity, and student life in an abstract form. One in particular showcases the evolving creativity of the Visual Arts Conservatory. Introduction to Style Writing, a Visual Arts class taught by one of the on-campus chemistry teachers, Mr. Mohamed, gives students a new medium and an unconventional canvas. Style Writing covers a non-traditional art form which is not typically taught in schools.  Students learn how to create with this medium in a safe, structured environment,” Mr. Mohamed said. CSArts gives students the opportunity to learn and grow in a way they would be unlikely to elsewhere. Graffiti is a contemporary form of art, which originated in New York City in the 1970s. Mr. Mohamed credits the purpose of the class as a testament to the history of stylistic writing, in order to pass on the tradition of graffiti to a new generation. Graffiti is also most commonly found in locations with an abundantly diverse population. CSArts is lauded by many for its diversity and accepting culture, as it provides students of various backgrounds with equal platforms and opportunities to express themselves.  Students choose a name at the beginning of every year, something that is important to them,” Mr. Mohamed said.  It could be a nickname or an alter ego. ” He went on to say that the students spend the semester creatively turning this chosen name into graffiti art. When Style Writing students aren’t spending their time painting on walls, they watch documentaries on the history of style writing, work out new ideas in their sketchbooks, and critique the work of their peers, which helps them perfect their projects.  Every year at the end of the semester the whole class works on a collaborative mural together,” said Mr. Mohamed.  My favorite would have to be from last year’s class. ” The said mural was a massive stylistic writing of the words “SPACED OUT” with a green alien in a galactic background. It’s painted over now, but come December, a new one will take its place. However, those past murals still exist, and will forever be a testimony to the history of the Visual Arts Conservatory, just behind the paint. "

    "body": "2022/02/10 - As an avid Goodreads user, for the last year I have heard nothing but good reviews about Crying in H Mart by Michelle Zauner. After reading, I agree with all the praise that this memoir has received. In Zauner’s book, she explores her experiences with identity, family, grief, culture, and food. Crying in H Mart shares all of Michelle’s struggles with being biracial from childhood when she would feel left out during Korean school to adulthood when she loses her mother, her connection to her Korean heritage.  Sobbing near the dry goods, asking myself, Am I even Korean anymore if there’s no one left to call and ask which brand of seaweed we used to buy? Zauner not only shares about her Korean American experience but also shares about her journey to becoming a successful musician when everything was turning against her. She shares anecdotes throughout the memoir that would inspire any creative. The experiences and life lessons she learned doesn’t only apply to Korean Americans, biracial people, children of immigrants, or creatives but applies to everyone through the ideas she shares about belonging, grieving, and dreaming. The stories Zauner shared evoked memories of my childhood and opened the idea that others have had similar experiences to me. Although I am not a biracial Korean American, some of the struggles Zauner had made me feel seen and I think many others would feel that way about her stories despite being Korean. Her stories of visiting South Korea reminded me of the time I first visited when I was in elementary school, making me long to visit. The vibrant descriptions of the food and sights she saw gave me wanderlust. If you weren’t convinced to visit South Korea in the past, after reading this book you will for sure be looking for tickets to Seoul. The one thing that stood out to me the most about this memoir was the imagery all throughout making the reader feel like they were a side character in every experience. Michelle Zauner’s memoir is a great start if you are wanting to start reading memoirs or want to learn more about the Korean American experience. It is definitely worth reading and deserves all the praise.  “Gwaenchanh-a, gwaenchanh-a,” she said. It’s okay, it’s okay. Korean words so familiar, the gentle coo I’d heard my whole life that assured me whatever ache was at hand would pass. Even as she was dying, my mother offered me solace, her instinct to nurture overwhelming any personal fear she might have felt but kept expertly hidden. Michelle Zauner, Crying in H Mart "

Winter Formal was held on February 5th, and tickets were already sold out days later as students excitedly prepared for the event. The theme for this year’s formal was Old Hollywood. Old Hollywood, also known as Classic Hollywood, is a term used to describe the fashion, film, and overall glamour associated with American cinema from the 1930s to the late 1950s. Famous stars from this era would be actresses such as Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, and Judy Garland, as well as actors like Henry Fonda and Marlon Brando. Old Hollywood is legendary, setting trends for both fashion and film. The style of Old Hollywood is full of glitz and glam with an air of both sophistication and class. The women of Old Hollywood would don bright red lipstick and pearly white jewelry, complete with full-length gowns to shine and sparkle. As for the male fashion, sharp fitted suits and tuxedos paired with fedoras and ties were the go-tos for male stars. Their hair would also be stylized to be prim and proper, and most important, quite dapper all together. This year’s Winter Formal isn’t the first instance of taking inspiration from the past either. Earlier this year in October, CSArts had Homecoming, which was themed around the famous music festival Woodstock during the 1960s. The style of Woodstock is a definite contrast to Old Hollywood, involving far less glamour and looser, casual clothing. However, each of the styles have their unique charms to them and are overall staples of American fashion as a whole. It’s safe to say that many at CSArts were ready to party with their friends at Winter Formal, regardless of how red-carpet ready they dressed. After all, Hollywood still remains a beacon of the arts, no matter how much its style evolves and changes. "
