As an entity, we aim to serve as a designated open, public forum for freedom of expression for students to freely disseminate information and express their ideas. Under the rights delegated by the First Amendment and California Education Code 48907, we operate without prior review and produces content that reflects the views of the student body (within legal and ethical bounds). Our student editorial board and student staff members assume complete legal liability for the content of the publication. On our part, this includes openly admitting to and promptly correcting mistakes. By holding ourselves accountable for our work, we also are prepared to justify the actions we take and the content we publish. In the case of a student injury or death, coverage will generally take the form of hard news in which we will include the student’s name unless the a parent or student does not want the name to be released. However, we will respect the parents’ wishes for the way in which the student will be covered. Because we aim to deliver accurate information in our content, we will verify all facts surrounding articles both in print and online. Interviewed quotes will have the support of handwritten or voice-recorded transcripts. In the case that we mistake a fact, misquote someone, or publish photos of the wrong person or event in an online article, we will promptly update it with the correct information and make a note when the revision was made. For our print articles, revisions will be made when we publish the content online — unless the article is libelous, offensive, or editorializes a hard news topic, in which we will print a retraction the following issue. Furthermore, because we have the right to no prior review, it is all the more important to apply ethical prudence so that content is produced responsibly, keeping in mind the people’s best interests. The First Amendment’s protections intend to serve not the press, but the people. As journalists, we exercise these rights to thoroughly investigate and report all issues in an unbiased, objective manner. This unbiased method of reporting ensures that we fairly address all sides of an issue to uphold the truth for our readers. We will try to minimize harm by understanding the implications of our work and showing sensitivity to all sides of a story. Electronic media produced by this online newspaper is entitled to the same protections – and subjected to the same freedoms and responsibilities – as media produced for print publication. As such, they are not subject to prior review. These include, but are not limited to, posts, videos and tweets. Here, we try to reflect the voice of the student body as best as we can. Therefore, we welcome all types of feedback and student submissions. These submissions can come in form of student-produced articles and letters, photographs, editorial cartoons and guest opinion writers. We will publish these student submissions online if we determine that the content is truthful and relevant to the student body. We strongly urge student participation in order to encompass the entire scope of the CSArts community. "

    "body": "2025/11/21 - 1934-2025 There are few people in the world who have penetrated the public consciousness like Jane Goodall has. When she died, it sent a shock wave through the hearts of every person that learned about her brave work. I want to pay tribute to Jane Goodall and all the good she did for the Earth, and what her life encourages us to do. Jane Goodall first came into the public consciousness in 1963 when National Geographic published a groundbreaking article on her work studying Chimpaneeze’s. Her research on prime apes widened our understanding of our genetic siblings, and brought us closer to understanding our origin more than ever. Jane Goodall would continue working with Chimpaneeze’s for the rest of her life, becoming the official ambassador for chimpanzees all around the world. In her later years, she would go to classrooms all around the world to educate kids on our place in the world and the ways we can protect it. Creative Writing Instructor and minister of Unitarian Universalist Congregation Fullerton, Robert Blair, delivered a sermon dedicated to Jane Goodall and the Legacy she left behind. “The woman in her nine decades made so many changes in people's hearts and minds and spirits regarding the animal population, and how we humans have damaged and destroyed much of their living spaces and the environment that they lived in. She is prophetic in the way that she guided a young population mainly, to understand what we have done and how to make things right. ” I wanted to know why she was such a presence in our modern society, and why people loved her so much, and Mr. Blair gave me a goldmine: “She spoke languages between species, and spoke languages between generations,” Mr. Blair then goes on to talk about the last thing she did in life, which hit close to home. “She died in Pasadena on October 1st, getting ready to plant trees in Altadena because of the fire and getting ready to do her part with younger people, to try and correct what had been done. ” Jane Goodall will always stand in our hearts as a figure of grace, exploration, and valor and a symbol for the good a single person can do. Rest in Peace. "

    "body": "2025/11/21 - Once the Friday school bell rings, most students can’t wait to get home, take a nice warm shower, and nap through the whole weekend. For sophomore Julia Trinh, that’s far from normal. Trinh spends her free time educating young minds and volunteering at hospitals, speaking about the dangers of drug use and teaching Sex Ed in a safe manner. As a former foster kid, Trinh shared that her passion for volunteering came from her family history, a family member she watched walk down the wrong path and got involved in drug use. Trinh spoke about her volunteering work and the type of work they put in. What is your main goal for your extracurricular activities? “Well, I fall under three categories: legislative, school policies, and restorative practice, which is a kind of harm reduction. That’s where I teach people about Fentanyl, overdosage, and narcan. And then I also sex education. But my goal is just to educate everyone on my topics that I work on and hopefully to make a better place. ” What or who got you started in your activities? “I think, myself, but for mostly harm reduction, which is what I mostly deal with. I would say when the family member did substances when I was younger. I saw the effects of what had happened and I wanted to make sure another family doesn’t have to go through that. Or at least, like, know how to go through it properly and get them treatment. And then for legislative work, this world is a little tough with the laws and stuff, and I think it needs to be fixed. ” What’s your favorite thing about these activities? “I think my favorite activity within these is meeting new people all over Los Angeles County. We really get to see a bunch of different aspects of lids within LA, especially since I think we all know LA’s a very vast community and I think getting to see that personally is really interesting. And going to different places all around is really fun. I get to see new things and meet new people. So I think it’s really nice to meet new people and then really use their experience and use that for good. ” On average, how long do you spend time volunteering? “I would say at least five hours a week. ” Where do you tend to volunteer? “I work at, I kinda work cause I do get paid for it, Reach LA, which is a LGBTQ-BIPOC nonprofit in downtown Los Angeles and that’s where I do my Sex Education and legislative. Then Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, with the collective of theaters, where I do my harm reduction. So yeah, it’s mostly there. ” What would you want to say to somebody who wants to get into this field? “I’d say building a network is very important. That’s how I go to so many places. And work on public speaking cause that’s a very critical component. Also, depending on what you do, like what I do, making presentations. It’s also just about having a heart and understanding. Personally, I don’t think you should do it for any college things. It’s a very personal work so I think you are made for it, but sometimes it need to be found. ” "

    "title": "Library or Storage Closet?",
    "body": "2025/11/21 - Cramped into a storage closet inside CSArts’ cafeteria lies the school library. The small room holds a few chairs, a couple of coffee tables, a love seat, and a desk. Bookshelves line the farthest wall. Despite being labeled The Creative Writing Library, it is, in reality, a supply closet with bookcases—open only during limited office hours. The books are also only available to Creative Writing students, leaving the rest of the school without access to on-site reading materials. In an interview, Mrs. Read explained why CSArts has not prioritized establishing a formal library space. “Libraries are very expensive—a middle-tier library would likely cost $500K+—and the truth is that we continue to be significantly underfunded for our arts program. That is always the top priority,” she said. “We work to encourage all families to donate to their CFA as well as expand the ask to our large-scale donors. ” Although research widely supports the impact of free reading materials on literacy, vocabulary, and academic performance, Mrs. Read emphasized that the school is not currently concerned about student reading scores as we already out perform the California average. She recommended that students take advantage of the Duarte public library that is about a ten minute walk from the CSArts campus if they are in need of a book not available at school. “I wish the school put in more funding to establish a real library. I know where the library is but I never use it because it’s so small and always packed. I think it’s also unfair that it only caters to Creative Writing students,” said an anonymous Popular Music senior.   CSArts has onboarded more students in the past years, so much so that conservatories like Creative Writing and Acting have had to relocate to empty DHS classrooms. In a recent survey sent out by the school, it asked students to rank how they would like to prioritize new additions to the school. Some of the things on that list included creating new office space for administrators. So, why is the focus on space for administrators and not students? Read responded, “You’ve stumbled upon a topic the admin team and I discuss all the time. DHS has been very generous in sharing space with us and that has allowed us to keep our Conservatory class sizes lower than academic classes. We could keep everyone on our campus during Conservatory, but that would cause us to raise class sizes in Conservatory up towards 30:1 and would mean fewer class options for students. Our ultimate goal is to build more permanent structures on our campus, perhaps on the field. But like I mentioned earlier, this would cost millions and we are not there yet. But, we’re taking lots of steps in our Foundation and Development offices to hopefully make this possible one day. ” Read said that it’s possible that CSArts could “perhaps,” include a library in the building plans for a structure, but she said,  “all the metrics (school test scores, grade data, matriculation data, LCAP goals, committee notes, survey data, etc. ) does not indicate that students are disadvantaged because we don’t have a traditional library. I would be hard pressed to convince any of our boards to divert funds from our other initiatives, when there is a public library within walking distance of the campus. To your point about growth - students continue to be interested in our school, which is a good thing. ” Read added that CSArts-SGV wants to serve as many students as possible, “but you’re right, at some point we’re just out of room. Increasing enrollment does several things for us, namely: it increases our state funding and our parent CFA funding, it’s job security for our amazing staff, it keeps our program working with DUSD as they need support in keeping their enrollment up due to state-wide concerns about declining enrollment, and increasing enrollment brings more diversity to our campus and flushes out the smaller conservatory programs.   Read said the school experiences 4% attrition every year, which means CSArts overenrolls at the start of Fall Semester and then numbers settle by October. “I’m sure you have felt the difference on campus? We started with 1060 and we are now at 1019. While growing enrollment is exciting because it means we’re in demand, stable enrollment is the true goal. Stable enrollment is what big-time donors, grant programs, and banks want to see before they invest in us, and it is those types of relationships that will eventually allow us to build more permanent structures and more state-of-art art spaces. ” I asked the Pop Music Senior how they felt about the increased onboarding of students and the current facilities of the school.   Speaking anonymously, they said, “I understand why they need to add more students for funding but there are so many things that go unattended like the plumbing, wifi, and lack of library for example that it’s unfair to us as students. ” Funding continues to be an ongoing issue for CSArts. If you are able to contribute to the CFA, it goes directly towards building a better campus for all students. "

It’s inspiring to see how CSArts students continue to impact the community, and we hope to see an increase this year,” said Natalie Lanza, president of the Interact Club. Blood drives are essential in ensuring that patients have the resources they need to continue fighting. Nationwide shortages and declining donor turnout have made donations more valuable than ever. “It’s a simple act, but can truly make a difference for the patients at City of Hope,” said Francis Fong, Senior Blood Drive Coordinator. “Even in my own life, my son was diagnosed with leukemia when he was just eight years old. Thanks to the treatment he received and the generosity of blood donors, he is now a two-time leukemia survivor and recently celebrated his 25th birthday. ” Appointments can be made by scanning the QR codes posted around campus. Walk-ins are also accepted. Donors must be at least 16 years of age, weigh a minimum of 110 pounds, provide a valid photo ID, and be in good health. Give hope, it’s in your blood. "

    "body": "2025/11/21 - A recent visit to a museum introduces students to part of a Chinese army of warriors, as a result of joint efforts between school personnel, the museum, and a private organization. On Saturday, October 11th, a group of CSArts students, parents, and teachers visited the Bower’s Museum in Santa Ana on a mission: to see the Terracotta Warriors in person. The terracotta warriors are an army of an estimated eight thousand unique statues, built by the first emperor of China Qin Shi Huang over 2,000 years ago to protect his belongings from tomb robbers. Of these eight thousand, the Bower’s museum had five on display–the third ever time they have been displayed in southern California. It all started with an email. According to Nana Yang, the Mandarin teacher at CSArts, the chairman of the Chinese American Federation (CAF), Fei Pang, emailed her with the offer of free tickets to the Terracotta Warrior exhibition at Bower’s Museum. Yang, knowing how important Chinese history is to the Chinese AP exam, accepted almost instantly. The trip was split into two parts, including a guided tour of the exhibit, and a crafting activity where visitors had the opportunity to make their own miniature terracotta warriors out of clay. During the tour, the guide in particular stood out to Yang. “She started her presentation to introduce herself with her connection with China and her understanding of Chinese culture,” says Yang, appreciating the tour guide’s traditional Chinese robes. But Yang says the crafting activity was even better. “That was my favorite part of the tour– the museum visit,” says Yang. The differences in the handmade student terracotta warriors show how each student views the Terracotta Warriors– and, on a broader level, Chinese history. Yang hopes that this trip has shown her students, even at a beginner level, an exploration of Chinese history, and she hopes that they are able to explore it with an open mind. To Yang, the most valuable part of the visit was the connections built between the people who attended– students, parents, grandparents, teachers, and CAF members, all coming together to learn Chinese history and culture. However intangible, a bond, a connection is built, with a mutual appreciation for two thousand year-old culture. "

    "title": "History of Mexican American Music - Part 3",
    "body": "2025/11/21 - The 1980s and 1990s saw Mexican American musicians break through into a variety of popular music genres in ways past generations had not. Some of the biggest artists of the era were Rage Against the Machine, Selena, Linda Ronstadt, and Ozomatli. All of whom built on the foundations of artists who had come before them. Mexican American musicians were truly mainstream. Linda Ronstadt, whose career began in the sixties as a folk singer, made the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine as a rock singer. It is challenging to characterize this era with a single sound or type of artist. Ozomatli was a funk band, Selena was the Queen of Tejano music, and Rage Against the Machine was a multi-style band with politically charged lyrics. Funny enough, the different styles of these musicians are in direct relation to artists of the past. At this stage of history, a throughline can be seen from past artists. In this article, I aim to highlight these artists and reflect on their impact on shaping the traditions of Mexican American Music. Linda Ronstadt, discussed in the previous article, was a popular mainstream artist well into the 1980s. She was a rock singer who was not known for her Mexican American heritage, similar to Riche Valens. However, in the late 1980s, she won numerous awards by finally embracing her Mexican American heritage and releasing an album in Spanish, “Canciones de Mi Padre”. She spoke of the difficulty of getting her record label to agree to produce the album. Ronstandt fought to have it released, as it honored her father and the music she grew up listening to on her family’s ranch. She described making the album as a vital part of her artistic journey.   Rage Against the Machine, although not being an entirely Mexican American band, had a lead singer who was mixed-race and proud of his Mexican American heritage. The band even released a track called “People of the Sun” about Mexicans. Rage Against the Machine, being a multi-styled musical band, can be seen as an evolution of the Zeros and their style of music, as well as their strong ties to Los Angeles. Ozmatlie has a similar relation to their predecessors. In many ways, Ozmatlie does have its own unique blend of jazz and even hip hop; however, it does share similarities with past Mexican American Funk Bands, like El Chicano. Ozamtlie builds upon the foundation set by El Chicano, creating a genre-defying sound. Selena is perhaps the most interesting and direct connection to Mexican American musicians of the past. She was a tejano artist who was considered equally as popular in the U. S. as she was in Mexico. Her fame was wide, and her music was classic. A strong comparison can be drawn between her and the artist, Lydia Mendoza. Selena was often referred to as the Queen of Tejano music, while Mendoza was believed to be the first queen of Tejano music and a pioneer of the style. Selena played a big role in popularizing the genre. Both artists also had the unique ability to capture audiences in both the U. S. and Mexico.   The 80s-90s were a time of modernizing tradition and building upon the legacies of those who came before. The artists of the 90s found mainstream fame and perfected genres of the past. Without this generation, the explosion of modern Mexican music in the modern era would not have occurred. "

    "body": "2025/11/21 - “Wherever art is going in the world, we should be able to provide that for our students,” says Allison Hennessey, the new assistant principal of the arts at CSArts. With that philosophy in mind, she is stepping into the role with a vision to inspire both students and teachers alike. Hennessey has been with CSArts since the school first opened in 2017. She was the Chair of the Dance Conservatory. Even after her move to Ohio, she stayed with the school. With Dr. Cook’s resignation as Assistant Principal of the Arts, she decided to apply for the open position. With a strong foundation in dance, she emphasizes that leadership isn’t about controlling every corner of the arts program, but about trusting the experts who surround her. “I believe in supporting people so they can flourish in what they do,” she said, explaining that trusting each director to lead their programs is central to her approach. “Sometimes with growth, there also needs to be a moment of settling into them…and really fulfilling what we already have,” Hennessey said. With the addition of the Popular Music Conservatory and the 6th-grade program, the school is allowing some time for easing into those expansions. So, we won’t be seeing any drastic changes made to the Conservatories. Instead, she and her team will focus on improving current conservatories and on supporting Conservatory directors and teachers to provide the best programs for students. As she steps into her new role, her goal remains clear: to strengthen a community where every artist, teacher, and student can thrive. "

These little critters are known as June bugs because it’s their most active month of the year. Adult junebugs emerge from the soil nearing the end of spring, typically May and June, greeting the transition into Summer weather. June bugs spend most of their life underground and the warmer weather and longer days activate their muscles. Most of the time, junebugs are just trying to find a nice warm place to reproduce. They may unintentionally fly into your path but these green beetles mean no harm. Their diet includes almonds, strawberries, sugar cane, roses, potatoes, and corn, which can bother farmers who grow these crops. These bugs are exploring the world but are simply blind and aren’t trying to crash land into you.

Exterminators spray insecticide on campus once every few weeks. Last month, they sprayed several times in one week. “They did it over three small doses,” Ms. Read said. “We have to be careful not to overdo it in order to protect our students since insecticides can be powerful chemical agents. ” The school also has to follow state environmental restrictions for pesticides. Cockroaches are not aggressive. “While cockroaches can certainly be gross and scary, they will not hurt you,” said Ms. Read. However, an infestation of roaches can cause harm.

This directly opposes the main world, Earth 0, which contains hope and justice at its core. Darkseid’s soul cursed the Elseworld, giving the usual characters in DC different stories. Absolute Batman, for one, isn’t rich like in the original universe. Instead, he’s a lower class man depicted with multiple different jobs, one of which being a construction worker. This reimagination highlights the intelligence of Bruce Wayne by showing his capabilities in different circumstances and not just when he’s wealthy. When he was a child, his dad was killed in a shooting at the Gotham zoo, leaving his mom as a single mother and taking away from the  nothing to lose” aspect of the original Batman. Another example is Absolute Superman, who instead of being sent to Earth as a baby, was sent to Earth as a young boy. Kal-el’s connection to Krypton separates him from the human aspect of the original Superman, creating the biggest difference between the two: a lack of his alter-ego Clark Kent. Kal-el is guided by his suit which contains Kryptonian artificial intelligence, and actively seeks perpetrators of social injustice and oppression parallel to his parents’ past efforts to save Krypton from corruption. This Superman is in his teens, making the change from Krypton to Earth more recent and causing him to be much more angry and emotional than the original. Superman enthusiast Noah Johnson, who is an Integrated Arts senior at CSArts, expresses how he’s yet to read Absolute Superman due to hesitance over the major changes. Although a fan of Superman and the Absolute series altogether, he shares a concern on the adaptations of the character and says, “I still prefer normal Superman because of what he symbolizes”. Nevertheless, Noah approves of the new storylines saying, “Whoever is coming up with this stuff deserves a raise. ” Another senior at CSArts, Kayden Hicks, also shows an appreciation for the differences in the Absolute series. “I think it’s the most creative thing they’ve done in a couple years,” he says, “there’s been many spins on characters like Batman, but this one feels special. ” Kayden highly recommends Absolute Batman, and says that despite his preference in the Marvel universe, it piqued his interest. There are many more characters depicted in the Absolute series from heroes to villains. Other popular favorites include Absolute Wonder Woman, Absolute Flash, and Absolute Martian Manhunter. DC fan or not, this series is a gamechanger from the well-known narratives and could be a good read for any superhero fans. "

    "title": "Books, Bans and Control",
    "body": "2025/10/26 - The history of book banning in the United States runs almost as far back as its origin. Although lack of records makes it hard to pinpoint the first banned books in U. S. history, Uncle Tom’s Cabin is widely regarded as one of the first American books to be widely banned. Written by white abolitionist author Harriet Beecher Stowe, the novel followed the lives of a group of fictional enslaved people in the South. It became extremely popular in the North among abolitionists but faced harsh criticism in the South. Before long, widespread bans took effect across the region. Book bans are not new. They are a recurring form of cultural control that often reflect a society’s deepest fears. Uncle Tom’s Cabin threatened both the economic and moral justification of slavery, and banning it became a way to maintain control over the narrative. Examining historical examples of book bans is important because censorship has often served as a warning sign of larger shifts away from democracy. In Germany during the 1930s, books considered “non-German” were banned and burned during the “Campaign against the Un-German Spirit. ” Jewish, queer, socialist, and Marxist works were targeted. The campaign operated under the guise of protection, claiming to “cleanse” Germany of dangerous ideas. The control of information became a way to control people, helping pave the way for the rise of the Nazi regime. History shows us that book bans are rarely about protection. They are about power, deciding who gets to speak, and protecting existing power structures. In modern times, book banning has re-emerged across the United States at an increasing rate, often in schools and public libraries. Thousands of titles have been challenged or removed, many for addressing race, gender identity, or sexuality. These stories are often targeted by claiming that they are a threat to “American values. ” Underdog Bookstore, a bookstore in Monrovia, CA, is a non-profit that features LGBTQIA+, BIPOC, Disabled and Neurodiverse authors. “Books by authors of color; stories that feature LGBTQIA+ characters; books by women, written about women…. all of these are banned at higher rates. ” Said Underdog Bookstore President Kealie Mardell-Carrera and Underdog Bookstore Board Member, Banned Books Club Host Nicole Arca. The argument of protection has been used to justify erasing what threatens the existing power structures and social norms. In the 1800s, it was stories about slavery. In the 1930s, it was Jewish writers. Today, it’s books that explore race, gender and sexual identity. Many of the arguments in support of book bans in schools and libraries follow the idea that children do not need to be exposed to the idea of gender, sexuality and race. One of the most vocal groups behind the modern wave of book bans is Moms for Liberty, a conservative organization that describes itself as advocating for parental rights in education. The group has gained significant influence at school board meetings and in local elections across the country, leading campaigns to remove books they deem “sexually explicit” or “politically biased. ” While their stated goal is to protect children, their efforts have targeted books featuring LGBTQ+ characters, discussions of race, or social inequality. “Limiting access to books, especially for younger readers, threatens our ability to understand parts of the world and people we may not encounter directly. There’s only so much we can see from our own lived experiences; books make the world a little larger for all of us and help us build empathy in the process. Those who claim that book bans protect children are often deliberately ignoring the difference between providing access to age-appropriate reading material, which is the norm in schools and libraries, and banning books because you personally disagree with the content. ” Said Nicole Arca. In recent years, these efforts have taken on a more organized and political form.  According to the American Library Association, “Pressure groups and government entities that include elected officials, board members, and administrators initiated 72% of demands to censor books in school and public libraries. ” During the Trump administration, rhetoric about “fake news” and “indoctrination” in schools has deepened the distrust in education and media institutions. This growing skepticism created an environment where removing books seems necessary to some. Project 2025, a political initiative backed by several conservative organizations including those closely tied to the Trump administration such as the Heritage Foundation, proposes widespread changes to federal policy, including reshaping education and cultural institutions to reflect “American” ideological values. While it doesn’t call for outright book bans, it is focused on controlling what is taught and how information is shared and places a heavy emphasis on white American nationalist evangelical viewpoints. It is important to note that President Trump denied any connection to Project 2025 during his 2024 presidential campaign, even stating during a televised debate with Kamala Harris, “I have nothing to do with Project 2025. I haven’t read it. I don’t want to read it, purposely. I’m not going to read it. ” However, in the past weeks he has held a private meeting with Russell Vought, one of the main authors of project 2025 and included him in an AI generated video posted on his “Truth Social” account. It is important that we are able to recognize why certain books are being targeted and understand who it benefits. It’s also important to ask ourselves who it harms. The removal of inclusive books from accessible places like public libraries can cause harm to children who may have otherwise been represented in those spaces. It can create a stigma around topics that reflect many American’s everyday lives leading to more division and a gap in connectedness and empathy. “When certain books or authors are stigmatized or silenced, it sends a message about which stories are considered acceptable and which are not. When censorship happens, it is definitely a warning sign of larger social and political issues. It is a clearcut attempt to eradicate original and individual thought by controlling the means by which people get their information. It’s no secret that knowledge is power, so banning or stigmatizing certain books is also a way to curtail the power of certain groups of people. ” Said Kealie Mardell-Carrera. The next time you hear about a book ban, ask yourself why was this book targeted? Who does the ban benefit and who does it harm? These attacks against literature are intertwined with the belief that controlling information can protect a nation’s identity. History shows that this control does the opposite. It weakens societies by cutting off conversation, empathy, and the exchange of ideas. "

    "title": "History Of Mexican American Music - Part 2",
    "body": "2025/10/26 - The era of 1960s and 1970s Mexican American music was significant. With the Chicano movement of the 1970s and national attention on Mexican Americans, musicians of this time reflected the era with their specific brand of music. Bands like El Chicano, Los Lobos are emblematic of this movement. While artists such as Linda Ronstadt and Santana were Main stage performers of this time, punk bands like The Zeros and Alice Bag, while less well-known, were highly influential. Los Lobos, El Chicano, and Santana are often regarded as the leading Mexican American bands of this era. Although these artists had unique sounds, they shared similar qualities, playing music reminiscent of American styles of soul and jazz with Latin influences. El Chicano, a band most prevalent during the 1970s, covered both Herbie Hancock, a prominent funk musician, and famous boleros like  Sabor a Mi.   El Chicano was a group influenced by the Chicano movement of the 70’s. Their music was representative of the Mexican American identity, blending Latin salsa influences and reflecting the fight for representation within American Society. Los Lobos is another band similar to El Chicano. It also had jazz and Latin influences along with folk, country, and rock. A group of high school students from East LA formed the band. The founding members bonded over their shared weird affinity for country music. The band members loved classic country and folk singers, such as Ry Cooder. They also loved to cover many of Riche Valens' songs. Much like the El Chicanos, Los Lobos were activists for the Chicano movement. Santana and Linda Ronstadt are two other artists of the time who represented Mexican Americans as large stars of the era. Santana, a guitarist and activist, was part of the 1970s rock movement, playing with Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead. Santana has had a long and successful solo career, producing hit songs such as  Oye Como Va  and  Black Magic Woman.   Later in his career, he was featured on Lauryn Hill's album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, which is ranked as the number one album on Apple Music's list of the 100 best albums. Linda Ronstadt is a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award winner who has performed across multiple genres, including rock, country, opera, and Latin Music. She was the first woman to have three consecutive platinum albums. Although Rondstandt did not celebrate her Mexican American identity until much later in her career, she was truly a pillar of Mexican American excellence during this time and beyond. Another less discussed area of music is the Mexican American punk scene. Primarily centered in East LA during the 1970s and spanning into the 1990s, there was a big Mexican American punk scene. Two of the best-known bands were The Zeros and The Bags. The Zeros from Chula Vista, California, were commonly referred to as the Mexican Ramones. They played large concerts in Los Angeles and San Diego while they were still in High School and were actually one of the first U. S. punk Bands. They played with The Clash and Devo. The lead singer and guitarist, Javier Escovedo, came from a musical family. His dad played in a mariachi band and passed his passion to all of his 13 children. Javier's older brothers played with Santana and Malo. The Zeros' music library is limited, but I highly recommend that all readers check them out. Their style feels ahead of its time. Alice Bag, on the other hand, was from East Los Angeles and created her own career as Alice Bag as well as a band called The Bags. She was a part of a wave of California punk artists that included Black Flag, X, and the Germs. Both of her parents were Mexican Immigrants. As with many Chicanos her age, Bag’s father immigrated through the Braseros program. Her experience as a Mexican American influenced her to be an activist and to come up with a style known as Punk-Chera. A blend of punk and ranchera performances. These artists were not only impactful to Mexican Americans during their time but to the music as a whole, evidenced by their awards, social commentary, influence, and prevalence today. "

    "title": "Senior Test Scores Down",
    "body": "2025/10/26 - High school seniors in the United States are experiencing steep declines in math and reading performance. With average scores at their lowest levels in over two decades, the issue is a serious cause for concern, especially among teachers and policymakers. Findings from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) indicated that 32% of 12th-grade students now perform below basic reading achievement levels, compared to 20% in 1992. Meanwhile, only 35% of seniors demonstrated proficient reading skills in 2024, down from 37% in 2019 and 40% in 1992. Similarly with math, only one-third of seniors performed at a level showing college readiness, compared to 37% in 2019. “Despite spending billions annually on numerous K-12 programs, the achievement gap is widening,” said Education Secretary Linda McMahon. There are several factors causing the downward trend. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted education and led to severe knowledge gaps. Changes in technology use and the way students consume information have also played a role. However, CSArts-SGV Principal Nicole Read cautions against viewing test scores as the end-all be-all. “There is so much going on right now, socially and emotionally, so I can see why students are struggling. I’m not surprised because scores have been on the decline for a long time, and this is just a continuation of that, unfortunately,” Read said. Although important for determining academic readiness, parents and students should not only focus on standardized test scores to define their self-worth. "

    "body": "2025/10/26 - Stage managing is no easy feat, it’s one of the most demanding theater jobs and requires full attention. That's why only a select few are chosen to take on the task. CSArts' new upcoming acting shows, Big Love, Women of Lockerbie and Moscow Moscow Moscow Moscow Moscow Moscow, give new opportunities for student stage managers to step into the spotlight. It’s an exciting lineup-it holds many new and unique responsibilities to the production and design students. The stage manager for Moscow, Akira Mack (P&amp;D ‘26), is an example of the dedication and hard work put into the shows. Akira's stage manager duties begin after school for rehearsals, where he is responsible for coordinating communication between the crew and cast, taking detailed notes, calling cues and much more. With only a couple of minutes to eat food before rushing away to the studios to ensure everything runs smoothly. Afterwards, he sits next to the director for the full rehearsal and takes comprehensive notes. The notes help actors identify areas of improvement and assist the crew in managing props. Usually around 9:00, rehearsals end. They need to send out emails reminding actors and staff of important deadlines and upcoming duties. Rehearsals are just the start, once tech week begins, the stage manager's list of jobs expands. Tech week stretches the times of rehearsal, making it end around 10-11:00 pm. Not to mention the stage manager has to start building the black box set for the actors. While also maintaining their original roles, stage managers must learn different blocking techniques, cues and tracking the actors on stage. ” I’ve had to learn fair share rehearsal reports, block, short hand, track where the actors are on stage,” Akira explains. “And practically learn another language, almost like hieroglyphics, to memorize scenes. ” Although years in production and design have prepared him for this challenge, Akira reflects, “ There are a lot of personal emotions with the first time stage managing. Mistakes are guaranteed to happen on large projects like these, it’s the crew and actors' ability to compromise that makes this a beautiful experience. ” "

    "title": "Housewife to Director: Women in Media",
    "body": "2025/10/26 - The early days of television had women playing housewives, mothers, and nurturing roles, but over the years, the involvement of women’s roles in media has taken a commanding shift. Women today are stepping into leading roles in front and behind the camera. These changes in the film and television industry positively increase the accurate portrayals of women in media. In a CSArtisan exclusive interview with the Senior Vice President of Physical Production for Funny or Die, Whitney Hadock said, “Now you can find women that are messy, smart, powerful, the list goes on. More and more often, we're also seeing portrayals of women with more than one body type and from more diverse backgrounds. ” A few of the main outcomes this vital shift had on the media industry are business choices, demographics, and leadership. “Women in positions of power within the media enable stories about women by women to get told and get told with the nuance that a human story requires,” said Hodack. “Sometimes it takes someone of the same community to show the business that investing in female-centered stories is a good business choice because it opens up a whole demographic that is willing to lean in and watch your programming and has been left out due to portrayals of very flat female characters in the past. ” People tend to underestimate the power of film and how it shapes the way people view the world around them. “When we are able to show women in positions of power, solving hard problems, not being perfect, and all the things that are not always thought of as female jobs or qualities, we are showing the world the possibilities of what women are capable of,” said Hodack. And she says it affects the people watching. “When girls and women watch this content, they start to understand that they can do and be these things as well. ” By featuring women from all backgrounds in film and television, filmmakers help to break the mold of how people think women are supposed to behave. The effects media portrayals have on a young person’s understanding of gender roles, body image, or career aspirations are formed through the media they watched while growing up. Showing women in a subservient, perfect, happy role leaves unrealistic expectations on women and children. “Showing women portraying doctors and writers and athletes and anything your heart can think of gives examples of all the ways girls and women can see themselves becoming anything they want,” Hodack said. This year, one-third of Emmy winners were women, and this ratio has become more favorable towards women over the years. The representation of women in the media industry doesn’t just fall under the acting category. “We need more female editors, DPs, and directors, roles that are traditionally thought of as male-dominated. When there are more women represented in each category, the odds of a woman winning increase, too,” Hodack said. “When I won my Emmy, there were ten producers on that project, and only two of us were women. ” Women in the media are breaking down the doors for the next generation. Women aren’t just motherly figures on screen; they are directors, screenwriters, cinematographers, and problem solvers. "

Lexy began her nail journey her freshman year of high school, “I started doing it because it helped me cope in a way,” she said. After spending time practicing nails on her friends who appreciated her talents, she discovered her passion for the art form. Lexy has plenty of experience in the fine arts as a visual art student, and being able to apply her artistic skills in her nail business comes in handy! It may seem difficult to balance school and an after-school business, but Lexy shows that despite the challenge, she is able to persevere with her interests. She said, “The school is very willing to work with me, so I have a good balance and schedule. ” Living near campus makes her work more accessible to her classmates who can go straight to her house after school and still be able to take the metro home if needed. One of Lexy’s past clients–Ocean Van Dam, senior at CSArts–said, “I’m sure anyone would have a good experience with her … she was really happy to accommodate any adjustments I wanted. ” Although Ocean had requested a short nail set, Lexy has shown her skill in all kinds of shapes and sizes, “She’s really meticulous with her nail art and skilled as well!” he said. Many students at CSArts enjoy getting their nails done, and Lexy has expressed a desire for clients to begin coming in with more creative ideas. Her favorite trends at the moment are polka dots and 3D sculpted ladybugs and monkeys. She can do many different styles and likes to work with her clients' preferences. She currently charges $35-$50, depending on size and design, and is always looking for new clients. Lexy can be reached on Instagram @lexxdonailss to book an appointment! "

Physical education teacher Luis Gutierrez says that athletic opportunity awaits you. He is offering to organize sports games for CSArts students during lunch. However, these games have to stay inside the gym, limiting different options for sports. “For us, we try to keep it inside the gym, so there’s a bunch of kids that play volleyball, or they’ll play basketball inside the gym,” says Gutierrez. But since he’s stationed inside the gym and cannot supervise the field, he is unable to organize games out there. There is a shed that contains sports equipment that Gutierrez supervises. He says that the shed contains many different kinds of equipment needed for PE classes. He says, “It’s only for inside sports. I don’t like to get footballs or soccer balls because the gym gets crowded. It just usually stays to volleyball and basketball. ” Gutierrez says that he doesn’t allow people to take out equipment to Northview Field. “In the past, we’ve had negative experiences where I give someone a soccer ball and they kick it on the roof or into the street. Or they just don’t give it back. So I just tend to give the indoor equipment because I’m there to watch over it. ” The sports options at CSArts are limited, but if you want more physical activity, pop over to the gym and talk to Gutierrez about volleyball or basketball. Or, you could bring your own equipment and play around on the field with supervision. "

    "body": "2025/10/26 - A recent online trend has created the label of “performative matcha lover” – a term used to define people, most often male, who use matcha as a way to appear more sensitive and feminist to appeal to women. This viewpoint, however, more often than not, does not truly explore the significance behind matcha itself. The president of the Co Cha Cup Club at CSArts, Ayleen Park, says that while being a performative matcha lover is usually used negatively, they also “might start by enjoying matcha for its popularity but then gain a deeper appreciation for its culture and significance. ” While cultural foods in general becoming popular could cause commercialization that ignores its cultural origins (ie. matcha being from Japan/China), Park also believes it could be exciting in the way that it might introduce people to new flavors or traditions they might not have tried otherwise. The Co Cha Cup Club is a place for people with similar interests to come together. While not explicitly a culture club, Park does say that the club “does touch on cultural aspects, since coffee, tea, and matcha all have deep historical roots”. The club is made to explore not only the drinks’ histories, but also to build communities, show support for local cafés, and to provide a welcoming environment for all students. Matcha is not just a trend– it’s a cultural food. Dating back almost a thousand years to Tang dynasty China, it was later passed onto Japan, where it was truly popularized and continues to be produced today. According to tenzotea. co, matcha is so culturally significant to Japan that they carry out a tea ceremony known as Chado, also known as the way of the tea, just to honor it. While the idea of the “performative matcha lover” has only become quite popular in the past few months, matcha has been around since between the 7th and 10th centuries. "

This year specifically, CSArts is spending somewhere between $20,000 and $30,000 for the venue, food, entertainment, and other costs. Because the goal with most school dances is to break even, ticket costs need to be high. This year, they cost 80 dollars, or half as much if you qualify for the free and reduced lunch program.

    "body": "2025/10/26 - Social media promises connection, but it also hides the side effects of infinite doomscrolling. The dark side of digital life has revealed itself in the Emmy-winning Netflix series “Adolescence. ” CSArts-SGV school psychologists say that the realities and accuracy aren’t far off. Adolescence is a Netflix limited series about the aftermath of a 14-year-old, Jamie Miller, killing a girl from his school, Katie. The show follows Jamie’s interrogation, family problems, and police investigation. The police investigation took a turn into the dark hole of social media, group chats, secret messages, and online bullying. And you may be asking, “How does the show connect to my life or the life of my friends and classmates?” (And if you’re not, bear with me). Although Adolescence can be seen as dramatized, it also accurately portrays the darker side of social media, which many teens and students of CSArts can relate to. First, is Adolescence accurate? According to Dr. Maureen Davis, lead school psychologist: yes, it is correct. “I think it does a good job highlighting how pervasive it can be, but also how serious it can be…there’s a wide variety of ways people can be bullied via social media,” Davis said. She added that the show was accurate in the ways that social media can expose individuals to online radicalization (which is when someone spends a lot of time online and gets exposed to extreme ideas, which slowly change their beliefs and support harmful or dangerous views). It is also accurate in the way that parents can sometimes be oblivious to what their kids are going through. The show’s accuracy also comes with teens and violence because of bullying. So, how does social media affect teens? “I think one of the main ways that social media affects mental health is that it increases anxiety and it lowers self-esteem…people don't put their worst days out on their Instagram page to show the world,” Davis said. Influencers only show the good things: the perfect shot, the perfect moment, the perfect look, the perfect plans. That idea of perfection is the catalyst for low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. That comparison between the artificial life on an artificial screen and the reality someone is currently living in. There can also be something called FOMO, which stands for “Fear of Missing Out. ” When someone sees their friends post pictures on social media and they are not included, it can make their anxiety worse. Davis described it as, “When you’re anxious long enough, you can become depressed…they’re best friends, anxiety and depression. ” Nevertheless, social media has its upsides: the connection you can have with your family and friends. Your family can be miles away, and the only way to communicate with them is through social media. And it’s easy to overlook the negative sides of social media because of the positive things. But there are some habits we can pick up to have a healthy relationship with our phones. First, it is recommended that 16 years of age is the appropriate age to get social media. When exposed to blue light, take breaks every 20 or so minutes to look at something far away or across the room to maintain good eyesight. When social media gets too overwhelming, take a break. It’s normal and healthy to withdraw from it. It doesn’t have to be for long, too. It can be for a day or an hour, or multiple days. Pacing yourself is important for your health, both physical and mental. Have your phone turned off and stay off your phone for about an hour before going to bed for your brain to wind down. The Cleveland Clinic states, “Your mind can stay active and engaged long after you’ve scrolled through social media or responded to a few work emails. ” They also state that the blue light from our screens affects our sleep, too, primarily our circadian rhythm. Our circadian rhythm works based on light and dark. So, we naturally feel more tired at night than in the morning. But the screens mimic daylight due to their artificial color, making us more alert. This leads to poor sleep quality, insomnia, and difficulties in falling asleep. It is also important that your goals are attainable. They can be something small, like stop using your phone half an hour before bedtime, or take a one-hour break from your phone. By learning to use social media with intention, this generation might finally reclaim what it means to connect. "

    "body": "2025/10/25 - Time to cover your canvas, students, as a new policy has been put in place that prohibits students from making art depicting the nude body. I was luckily able to get an interview with Leon Metoyer, an on-campus faculty member, to shed some light on the matter. When I asked about why this policy was put in place, he had this to say: “As a school, we are responsible for the possibility of a negative impact on the work of all students and families that attend or enter our campus. This practice was created out of an abundance of caution for everyone who enters and attends an event at CSArts-SGV. ” This new policy has gained some heat from those in the visual art world. An anonymous faculty member in the visual art sphere had this to say about the policy: “Whether you look at the birth of Venus, or if you look at the dying seated boxer, or if you look at the Menes Olympia, every epoch, every millennium has artists who deal with the nude in some way. ” The anonymous art teacher went on to say, “If you create a zero policy against it, you’re not exposing students to it when they need to be exposed to it. When they need the education, you can’t say, ‘Oh, they’ll just do it in college. ’ It’s too late by then. ” I asked whether this teacher felt there was a positive influence this policy could have and they said: “Well, there is an argument to be made that because students aren’t allowed to depict the nude body, that they will be forced to use their creativity more, to kind of work around that… Another good thing that might come out of it is it’ll help students decide where they stand, on whether they agree with it, or whether they don’t agree with it. You don’t have to agree with every policy everywhere you go, you know?” "

    "body": "2025/10/25 - Last month, four new Los-Angeles Metro stops opened. The new Metro stops are an extension of the Metro’s A-Line, with new stops located in Glendora, San Dimas, La Verne, and Pomona. Consistent riders are rejoicing in the opening of the new stops, yet with new riders beginning to take the train, safety tips are more important than ever. The Los-Angeles Metro has finally finished its extension of the A-Line. Four new stops have debuted as of noon on Friday, September 19th, 2025. The new Metro stops are located in Glendora, San Dimas, La Verne/Fairplex, and Pomona North. The extension connects riders to nineteen local college campuses. It also connects riders to Glendora Village, Raging Waters, Fairplex, and Fox Theater. It also connects riders to the Pomona Metrolink, Pasadena, Union Station, and Long Beach. The new metro stops also connect to bus and train lines, with the Glendora Station connecting riders to the Foothill Transit Line 284, the San Dimas Station connecting riders to the Foothill Transit Line’s 295 and 492, the Pomona North Station connecting riders to the Foothill Transit Line’s 291 and 492, alongside the Metrolink San Bernardino Line. The completed extension affects train schedules. Trains will run every eight minutes on weekdays during peak hours, every ten minutes during off-peak hours and daytime on weekends, and every twenty minutes on late evenings and overnight. It is essential that Metro riders, especially new Metro riders, are informed of Metro safety tips and resources. Los-Angeles Metro rides are being made safer thanks to the recent implementation of security cameras, better lighting, and a partnership with Law Enforcement. The security cameras are intended to monitor and deter criminal activity. The better lighting is intended to ensure visibility. The partnership with Law Enforcement is intended to accelerate response time. Los-Angeles Metro riders should properly prepare themself to stay safe on the Metro. This is best accomplished by consulting Metro’s suggested safety tips. Metro heavily suggests one safety tip: staying alert. Other safety tips suggested by Metro are to ride with friends, plan rides ahead of time, and report concerns to Metro officials. Metro also recommends that riders secure their belongings, stay organized, and to never run after or next to a moving bus or train. California School of the Art’s - San Gabriel Valley student, Ari Dawson, suggests another Metro safety tip: avoid individuals who making you uncomfortable while riding the train. Dawson explains, “I think it’s important if something is going on, like if you hear someone making a ruckus, you should be aware of it, but do not bring attention to yourself. Try not to interact”. Dawson’s suggestion mirrors Los-Angeles Metro’s safety suggestions to stay alert, and avoid individuals making you uncomfortable. For more Metro safety tips, regarding specific concerns or topics, or more information about the recently opened A-Line extension, consult the Los-Angeles Metro website. "

    "title": "CSArts Expands Phone Restrictions",
    "body": "2025/09/26 - This school year has brought noticeably stricter policies regarding student use of phones and chromebooks across nearly all classes. Students must now store their phones in designated phone charts, while computer usage has become more restricted. You may know from teachers and conservatory directors that this is based around a new state policy, but what is the bigger picture here? In 2024, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the Phone-Free School Act into law, requiring all K-12 schools to restrict phone usage on campus. “We know that excessive smartphone use increases anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues – but we have the power to intervene. This new law will help students focus on academics, social development, and the world in front of them, not their screens, when they’re in school,” said Governor Gavin Newsom. The policy, however, left schools to decide how much, and in what ways, it would need to be limited. Students in the Los Angeles Unified School District are facing the extreme, with a complete ban on cellphones and social media throughout the entire school day. Rather than implementing new restrictions, CSArts decided to strengthen the existing policy. With ninth-grade classes already using similar phone limitations and receiving positive results over the past few years, the practice was expanded campus-wide. CSArts conducted extensive research to ensure that student needs would be met, gathering input from the California Healthy Kids survey, working with students on the Operations Committee, and talking to parents and teachers. “Teachers have been pretty positive about the changes and saying that they have noticed student conversation picking up,” said academic principal Mrs. Read. It’s expected that the benefits from these policies will continue, and that the restrictions won’t be going away any time soon. "

    "body": "2025/09/26 - At the beginning of the school year, class lists were released, marking a fresh start for many students. Yet when it comes time to choose courses, history classes are often the ones students skim past without much thought. One newly created class, African American Studies, is not just a standard history elective, it’s been in development since the 1960s, when universities started advocating for more inclusion in education. Still in the U. S, only 700 schools in 50 states include AP African American Studies in their curriculum. The first Black studies program was established in San Francisco State University during a major Civil Rights era. The College Board launched the first high school pilot of AP African American Studies in 2022-2023. The formation of African American studies takes a new step of greater recognition for Black history and culture in education. “It’s needed to expand a student’s knowledge and experience. Keep the study of history alive and engaging. This class especially, because there’s a trend in the historical community that has adopted this social viewpoint of history” AP African American Studies instructor Mr. Turf said. CSArts is one of the few schools that has African American Studies as an option. As a school with a large racially-diverse population, having African American history available allows kids to see their own identities, cultures and give a fuller exploration of US history, one that constantly erases diverse historical stories. Colleges also see African American Studies as an impressive course. “The additional narrative of history is impressive to Colleges. It makes you look different because it’s only one of the few classes in America. Ethnic studies is a few years away from being a graduation requirement. They will be behind the future generation who have it,” Turf said. Students who take this course are seen as people who like to challenge themselves and are held higher than students who just take AP U. S. or AP World History. African American history shows resilience and focuses on the importance of community and identity, while continuing to fight an ongoing injustice, where people can see their stories reflected in history and contribute to discussions still relevant today.

Each of the gates has a keypad that students can open with the last four digits of a student ID. These are available on Aeries and on student IDs, and are different from cafeteria pins.

    "title": "Man’s Best Friend: An 80’s Fantasy",
    "body": "2025/09/26 - Shrouded in controversy and criticism before release, Sabrina Carpenter’s new album Man’s Best Friend debuts at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. Man’s Best Friend marks Sabrina Carpenter’s second debut at No. 1, after Short n’ Sweet last year. Man’s Best Friend takes listeners to an ’80s fantasy world. Carpenter utilized campy horror film visuals, a prominent 80s-inspired synthesizer, and lyrical choices reminiscent of ‘80s pop hits. Over the course of Man’s Best Friend, Sabrina complains on an imaginary phone call, taken over a plastic pastel blue rotary phone, about the various men in her life. Throughout Man’s Best Friend, Carpenter explores the trials and tribulations of the modern dating scene, focusing on how unreliable the men she dates are. Carpenter’s flirty and casual tone, prevalent throughout her song lyrics is more of a casual conversation between two friends, rather than a deep lyrical tale meant to criticize men, like fans had originally expected when the album cover was revealed. The album cover, which has become a polarizing point of recent conversation both about Sabrina Carpenter and about feminism, depicts Sabrina’s hair being aggressively pulled by what appears to be a man whilst she kneels in front of him. Critics worried that the sexual nature of the cover romanticized domestic abuse and would continue into the lyrical themes of the album. Critics also feared what the album cover suggested about Carpenter’s politics and her stance on feminism. “She’s an adult woman that’s expressing herself in the lens of the album,” Siena Fantini, a CSARTS-SGV junior and Sabrina Carpenter fan, argued. “I really hated that people were making these blanket statements about feminism before even hearing the album for more context”. In a recent interview with Interview Magazine, Sabrina responded to the discourse, “If I’m being completely transparent, I don’t do anything anticipating what the reaction will be. I only do things that speak to me, that feel right, and make sense when you hear the music. When I came up with the imaging for it, it was so clear to me what it meant. So the reaction is fascinating to me. You just watch it unravel and go, ‘Wow. ’” Now that the album has been released, many fans have found that Man’s Best Friend’s lyrical content was not what was expected. The storyline does not revolve around a tumultuous relationship or Sabrina Carpenter being taken advantage of. Instead, it tells the story of Carpenter’s struggle to find a relationship with a man she finds compatible. The lead single of Man’s Best Friend, “Manchild,” depicts this issue in detail. Sabrina Carpenter’s lyrics do not tell the expected story, but they do further transport the listener into the fantasy of an 80’s world. Carpenter’s lyrics, full of cliches, innuendos, and puns, reflect popular hits that define the era, such as Madonna’s 1989 classic,” Like a Prayer. ” Despite an album release shrouded in controversy and contemplation, Sabria Carpenter’s recent album Man’s Best Friend has risen to success. The album currently holds the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200. It also marks Carpenter’s biggest streaming week of 2025, as well as 2025’s biggest streaming debut for an album by a woman. "

    "title": "Traffic Jams on The Freeways & The Parking Lot",
    "body": "2025/09/26 - Following the new school year, the amount of traffic and congestion has increased along with the many new members of CSArts. Following the rise of students joining CSArts, traffic has increased along with it. With many families traveling from many different locations, and commonly between 8:20 and 8:30 a. m. There are many reasons for the traffic congestion. First, some students take the freeway. Many accidents occur on the freeway, which slows down traffic. Another reason that there could be so much congestion in the parking lot is, “500 families arriving between 8:20 and 8:30,” said Assistant Principal Leon Metoyer. Some precautions and actions can be taken by parents, guardians, and students. CSArts sophomore, Joanna McGee says, “I get dropped off at the front office, and there isn’t any traffic. ” McGee is usually dropped off before or at 8 a. m. and has been to class on time. The entrance to the office is located next to DHS and the Northview field. Meanwhile, Kazuri “Kat” Bartholomaus, a junior says she is late frequently and that the front office is always the quicker route. “We usually get here at 8 or 8:20. When we get here on time or as planned, traffic is really bad…we would have to wait 15 minutes and be late. ” If you or anyone you know who struggles with this traffic wants to help, there are many things that you can do to ease the congestion. First, get to school before 8:20. Traffic usually starts at that time, so if you want to beat it, come before then. Next, when being dropped off, be ready to hop out of your car. Have your backpack on already, lunchbox in hand, and everything else safely held by you so that when your parent or guardian drops you off, you immediately open the door and get out. This will ease congestion because if all students get out of the vehicle at the same time, then the lines will be moving faster. Drivers should pull forward as much as they can to make room for other drivers to enter the parking lot. This is a team effort to defeat tardies and traffic, and now, we know what to do to be part of the change. "

    "body": "2025/09/26 - It’s a Bird!! It’s a Plane!! It’s a Woke!? Superman ‘25 has been polarizing ever since the movie came out, with many praising the movie’s message of kindness, while others feel it was another movie with an woke agenda. This made me wonder about the role of Superman in our society and why he’s become so divisive with so many people, so I’ve decided to use Superman ‘25 and its messaging to look into it. The birth of Superheroes as a concept came during the 1930s with Superman. It was a way for people to escape from the harsh living many had to go through during The Great Depression. When Superman apperaed on shelves of magazine stores. he brought hope with him. However, as time rolled on people began seeing him as boring and old-fashioned. I decided to have a conversation with Drew Lansford to hear his thoughts on the movie and he gave me a gold mine. When I asked about the political messaging of the movie, Drew said, “I think a lot of people nowadays, especially with access to the Internet, are becoming a lot more radicalized and polarized, and that never manifests itself in a positive way, right? A lot of people generally are turning to hate more than anything else. And I think that a figure that’s unanimously popular, like Superman, needs to convey a message that is overwhelmingly positive. ” He then began criticizing some past depiction of Superman, especially from the Zack Snyder movies. Lansford said: “With Snyder, Superman was like an unkillable god who aurafarmed while people were dying and things were getting destroyed and things like that. And sure, it may have looked cool, but I think that from a hero like Superman, you want him to be good and kind and soft. ” Drew’s perspective on Superman makes me think about the movie’s portrayal of another iconic character, Lex Luthor. Luthor in the movie is a representation of ragebaiters, that manipulate people to cause outrage. He is such a good antagonist because he contrasts everything Superman stands for. The reason he loses in the end is because he underestimates Superman’s capacity for goodness. “The one thing liberals and conservatives can finally agree on is that Lex Luthor sucks,” says Sean Gunn, Director James Gunn’s brother. Superman ’25 is a combination of things; a satirical look at the way the media has divided the country, another entry into the Superman franchise, and a look into the importance of a character that is good, kind, and soft.

The Northview Field is a large part of our campus, mostly used for certain PE classes such as Taekwondo. There is significant confusion among the students that has led to many people believing that the CSArts field is closed off to all students during all three breaks. But, this is simply not true. The Northview Field is open to students as long as you aren’t in class. In fact there were students on September 3rd who were lounging in the shade by the building. “We’ve been open with only a few exceptions. If we’re using the field for a parking lot, obviously not those days. And if there is extreme weather we’re not doing it on those days,” said Assistant Principal of Facilities &amp; Supervision Mr. Metoyer. Metoyer also mentioned one more rule: students need to be supervised by a staff member present on the field at all times. He spoke about a struggle with finding available staff for this task, which is likely a reason for the confusion among the students. So then CSArts students, as long as you follow the rules, the field is your domain for all field-related activities. "

    "title": "History of Mexican American Music - Part 1",
    "body": "2025/09/26 - The Mexican American influence on music today is undoubtedly impressive, as seen in Mexican American artists playing pop or rock that tops charts, or even Spanish language or Latino music styles that have made it into the listening habits of Americans. Of course, being a Mexican American musician can be very difficult. These musicians faced conflicting ideas around identity, racism, and a host of other challenges. Despite the challenges of their environment, Chicano musicians have historically been pillars and representatives of Mexicans in the U. S. In this four-part article series, I will discuss four different eras of Mexican American music and the musicians that defined them. The first Mexican American musicians to really gain popularity started in the late 1920s. During this time of Mexican immigration and significant changes in the United States, artists like Lalo Guerro and Lydian Mendeza were some of the first popular artists of their time. Lalo Guerro was renowned for his comedic Chicano music, which resonated deeply with many Mexican Americans. His lyrics were funny and catchy, and reflected his own experiences growing up. Lalo sang in Spanish or in the Pachuco dialect. His music became iconic to Chicano culture. Luis Valdez famously wove Lalo’s music into his historic play, Zoot Suit, as it set the tone of the era. Lydian Mendoza is another Mexican American musician who started creating her music around the 1930s. Mendoza was born in Houston, Texas in 1916, during the wave of Mexicans fleeing the revolution back home. Mendoza played primarily Tejano music, a music genre that blends Mexican folk music with American styles of rock and blues. Her music told stories of the Mexican working class of Texas and resonated with many people of Mexican identity. Along with her popularity in the U. S. , her music got attention across the border as well. One of her first hit songs, Mal Hombre, was very popular and earned her a record contract with RCA. She had a long career and performed regularly into the 1980s. Mendoza was invited to sing at President Jimmy Carter’s inauguration in 1977, and in 1999, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts. Her style was truly representative of the blend of cultures above and below the border. Another influential artist who came to the scene later in the late 1950s is Ritchie Valens (Valenzuela). With a vastly more American style, Riche Vallens mainly played rock music despite his Mexican heritage. Born in the San Fernando Valley to two Mexican Parents, Riche Vallens was very much Mexican American, but at the height of his fame, managers and others in the music industry tried to hide that fact. They changed his name from Valenzuela to Vallens to Anglosize his identity. There was no mention of his Mexican American background. The one major exception to that fact was La Bamba. One of Richie’s biggest hits, La Bamba, was sung entirely in Spanish and was a way for Richie to celebrate his heritage. Although Valenz did know how to speak Spanish, he insisted on learning to sing the song as an homage to his identity and his family. On this list, Riche Vallens was the most popular in the U. S. Although he downplayed his Mexican American heritage, he was critical of the representation of Mexicans in mainstream American Media. Sadly, Valen’s short career ended in a famous plane crash along with Buddy Holly and J. P. Richardson. The artists discussed in this article are just some of the people who laid the groundwork for Mexican American musicians. If you’re curious about how Mexican Americans continued to grow from this point, stay tuned for the following articles in this series. Hopefully, by the end of this series, you will have a better understanding of Mexican American music as a whole and will have some good new artists to put in their playlists. "

Ranging from baggy pants to rainbow jewelry, fashion is used as a creative outlet. As the years go by, different style crazes pass, and students experiment with new clothing and accessories. But how do they keep true to their personal taste while exploring trends? Representing your voice through your physical appearance is a journey that can take a while and looks different for everyone. Fashion within students at CSArts is very diverse, with some taking inspiration from different decades, different cultures, and even from TV shows. Winston Rabon, a CSArts senior, claims to get inspiration from the 70s and 90s, “I kind of mix it sometimes; some days I wear flared jeans and some days I wear baggy. ” Winston agrees that his style resonates with how he perceives himself. Some of his favorite articles include boots, flared jeans, and tank tops. With the significance of music during the 70s and 90s, it is no surprise that this popular music student finds himself taking after them in his daily outfits. A very colorful japanese style called Decora is “ inspired by childhood, bright colors, children’s shows, and toys,” said Temple Stewart, a junior at CSArts who says she gets her outfit inspirations from the Decora style .  She wears lots of colorful beaded jewelry with toys and rainbow leg warmers among many other unique and vibrant accessories. Temple describes her style as “colorful, fun, and joyous,” expressing positivity with only her clothing. Besides international and historical influences, some students compare their style to TV show characters. 2000’s media seem to hold inspiration for many students, with Y2K making a comeback in the fashion space. “I feel like I dress like Lorelai Gilmore,” said Lucy Hunt, a senior, in reference to the TV Drama from the 2000s, Gilmore Girls. Lucy says that she likes to spice up her outfits with jewelry, scarves, and even just with her hair! Overall, fashion ranges from person to person, oftentimes reflecting their personalities. CSArts is a school where students with different styles can thrive in the diverse fashion culture. . When it comes to school attire, there is no such thing as over or underdressed, and creativity is always encouraged! "

    "title": "California Responds to Texas in Special Election",
    "body": "2025/09/26 - The possibility of redistricting is coming closer to reality in California with an upcoming special election. This election is set to decide whether or not the state will adopt a map of new Congressional districts. But why is this happening in the first place, and what even is redistricting? Each state has one or more Congressional districts, and voters can elect one Representative to serve in the US House of Representatives in Washington, DC. The political party with the majority of Representatives controls the House. Districts can be intentionally drawn to favor one party over the other, so that one party ends up with significantly more Representatives. This is called gerrymandering. States redraw their districts every decade after getting an estimate of the US population from the national census, which recently happened in 2020. So why is California redistricting mid-decade? This is because Texas is redrawing the districts, turning as many as five currently Democratic House seats Republican. The change is bringing in many accusations of gerrymandering. In response, the California Legislature approved a special election for 2025 that would allow voters to put a new map in place, taking back the Democratic seats in the House lost. Students at CSArts weighed in with their opinions. “If [California wasn’t redistricting] it would be like bringing a knife to a gunfight. […] We have to fight back before we can fix the problem,” freshman Ripley Ryan said. “Especially at a time of controversy like this, […] redistricting is absolutely necessary considering the current state of politics going on in Texas,” sophomore Adele Nelson Dahl said. On November 24th, 2025, the special election will determine whether California will get a new map of redrawn districts. Based on these maps, voters will decide the results of the midterm elections in 2026. "

    "body": "2025/09/26 - At the beginning of each school year, students must ask themselves one question, “Are the classes I’m taking worth it?” The question isn’t a simple one to answer. Mental strain, time spent and money are all a part of the equation. It is never recommended to overload yourself with rigorous courses. The challenge for students is getting the right balance between building an impressive transcript and maintaining strong grades. For some, this means taking multiple AP classes at once. For many students looking to bulk up their transcript, AP classes are an appealing option. They demonstrate academic rigor and prepare students for college-level work, but it may also come at the cost of late nights, stress, and burnout. And while passing the course itself is an achievement, students must also score well on the AP exam which costs nearly $100 per test in order to earn college credit. “AP is more of a gamble and it’s not always worth it. With CCC classes I know I am going to get a pay off for the work I’ve done,” said Creative Writing senior Natalie Lanza. Dual Enrollment has become an increasingly popular alternative to AP. These courses allow students to take college-level classes, often for free, and earn credit simply by passing the class. Without the added pressure of a test at the end of the course, dual enrollment can feel more accessible. Still, these courses are not without their challenges. They demand responsibility, maturity, and the ability to adapt to a college classroom environment while still in high school. Both AP and dual enrollment offer clear advantages, but they also come with challenges. Neither option is universally better. The right choice depends on the student’s goals, learning style, and ability to balance workload with other responsibilities. In the end, the most important consideration is not just how impressive a transcript looks, but whether the courses chosen support both academic success and personal well being. "

    "body": "2025/09/26 - As AI becomes more and more common in high schools nationwide, both concerns and praise have arisen towards what it means for the future of education. In these changing times, two CSARTS teachers provide their opinions. Student Uses: Do’s and Don’ts: According to Timothy Gomez, CSArts-SGV Creative Writing Director, AI does not keep our brains sharp. “I would rather get a C paper from you that’s actually YOURS and I can help you improve rather than an A paper that isn’t yours and you can’t grow from!” Teacher Uses: Limits &amp; Obscurity: Computer Science Teacher Jake Read says AI is a tool for teachers to do things for students, helping them in ways they could not in the past, such as: creating a study guide, helping to brainstorm examples for lessons, and completing tasks the teacher does not have time for. Nevertheless, Read says, “if the AI does all the work for the teacher, which isn’t possible yet, but let’s say it was, then you basically make yourself obsolete. ” Looking Toward the Future: Views on the future of AI are torn, even within the faculty of CSARTS. While Gomez believes in AI tearing rifts between students and teachers due to false claims and imperfect detection systems, others see things in a more positive light. “I think that it has made us more efficient and less resentful of work,” says Read. Students, he says, grow resentful because they have nobody to help them when they get stuck. With AI, that no longer becomes an issue. But, that doesn’t mean AI use goes completely unchecked either. Mr. Read requires AI use to be transparently stated, and even holds an offline exam every unit to ensure that his students are understanding, even without the use of AI. You can find the current CSArts-SGV AI Policy in the student handbook. "

    "body": "2025/05/16 - Looking back on the past two years, I can confidently say that no club has shaped me, or received more of my time and dedication, than CSArtisan. And while it’s true I’ve spent many long nights trying to puzzle out the seemingly endless amount of things that can go wrong when one is putting together a newspaper publication, being involved in this whole process has truly allowed me to blossom into the writer I am today. I’ve learned so much from every person who comes through the CSArtisan. I’m especially grateful for those who have helped me along the way. Thank you Mr. Blair, for fostering a love of newspapers in me despite the difficulties that arise with every publication. Thank you Evyn, not just for keeping me sane, but for helping me laugh through it all. And, thank you Minji, who showed me how to lead and be confident with every forward step I take. One of the most rewarding parts of this process is just being able to read about events on campus and feeling like I get to attend every single one through each article. Over the past years I’ve learned just how important accurate news information is. Whether we’re reporting on a recent movie, a student play, or the effects of school policy on our student population, I’ve witnessed how helpful having access to accurate and unbiased information is. 	I have also, however, witnessed the importance of maintaining access to free and independent information. Around the world, journalism has often been one of the first things to come under fire in times of rising authoritarianism or political instability. Throughout history, we’ve seen how governments can manipulate information to control public perception. Even in modern contexts—from the targeted discrediting of AP News sources to media blackouts in conflict zones—these patterns persist. That’s why media literacy matters now more than ever. We must stay vigilant, especially in a digital landscape where information is constantly fed to us by algorithms designed to reinforce existing beliefs. Here’s what I’ve learned to keep an eye out for:  Check the source: Is it reputable, or does it have a clear political or commercial agenda? Look for sensationalism: Headlines designed to provoke emotional reactions often sacrifice accuracy.  Cross-reference information: See if other reliable outlets are reporting the same facts.  Beware of false balance: Not every issue has two equal sides—some “debates” are manufactured to create doubt.  Analyze imagery and language: Are certain groups being portrayed with loaded words or dehumanizing visuals? Consider who’s being quoted—and who’s not: Whose voices are being centered or silenced?Propaganda thrives in environments where critical thought is discouraged. So let’s encourage each other to question, to read widely, and to protect the integrity of truthful reporting. To everyone who’s been part of this journey—whether as an editor, writer, advisor, or reader—thank you. I’ve grown not just as a journalist, but as someone who believes deeply in the importance of truth, transparency, and community. Here’s to the stories we’ve told, the truths we’ve uncovered, and the voices we’ve uplifted. And here’s to continuing that work with courage, care, and curiosity. Stay safe, stay sharp, and never stop asking questions. "

    "title": "Next Steps for Juniors",
    "body": "2025/05/16 - The transition from junior to senior year is one of the most important, and demanding, parts of high school. With a packed schedule during the school year from homework, conservatory classes, and extracurricular activities, many students see the summer as an opportunity to relax. However, according to your CSArts counselors, it is also a great time to prepare for what’s ahead. The CSArtsian has created a list of next steps to help incoming seniors out. Get Ahead on College Applications: The Common App and UC Application open on August 1st. Begin drafting and brainstorming essays and personal insight questions. Juggling senior year coursework with college applications may be difficult, so starting early will reduce your stress in the fall. Pursue Your Interests: Explore the subjects and activities you are passionate about and want to pursue in college further. Whether it’s taking community college courses, summer programs, volunteering, or internships, these experiences can provide valuable insight. College Visits: Visiting different colleges can help you get a better idea of how the environment, student life, and academics are, which is essential when deciding what schools are the right fit for you later on. Many colleges offer campus tours, Q&amp;As, and information sessions. Have A Money Talk: Financial discussions with your parents or guardians about college are vital for the college planning process. Understanding the costs of tuition, housing, books, food, and more helps you make informed decisions when choosing where to apply. “This is the last year to get involved in activities, clubs, and communities that you have not done in the past, so take advantage of what’s available at CSArts,” says Ms. Shiroma, Head Counselor.

    "body": "2025/05/16 - The Production and Design conservatory isn’t usually under the spotlight. That’s about to change at this year’s third annual Crew-Lympics on May 22nd. Crew-Lympics tests P&amp;D skills in Olympic-style games. P&amp;D adopted it from other technical theatre departments. “It was a way that we can have our students showcased front and center onstage,” said director of P&amp;D Adam Roy. “Typically when they’re doing their jobs well, the audience doesn’t notice them at all. ” The games range from fake food prop designing or audio mixing contests to scene change or quick change races. There’s roughly one game or contest for each P&amp;D area of study, which fall under the umbrella of three tracks: Scenery and Props, Costume and Makeup, and Theatre Technologies. For a bigger picture, CSArtisan talked to three P&amp;D students about their work and experiences in P&amp;D. “When you do big shows, you always have to expect that you’re going to stay later for at least two weeks, so you always have to clear your schedule around this time,” P&amp;D sophomore Luna Nguyen said. Luna has been in multiple P&amp;D roles, including deck crew (moving set pieces), props crew (organizing the prop table), and sound board operator (managing sound cues). She was also the assistant stage manager for Into the Woods. “It gets pretty hectic sometimes,” she said. “I tend to run backstage through the crossover a lot just to be able to communicate with the other people who aren’t on headsets. ” Senior Jayden Abogado also worked on Into the Woods, by designing costumes and running the costume shop in room 206. There, she filled out budgeting papers, sewed, and gave tasks to other students in the costume crew. Sadie Ondich is a rising junior who is also interested in costumes and makeup. This year she worked on the Fall Festival and on the makeup for Arsenic and Old Lace. One day she hopes to be a head of a Costume or Makeup role, like designer, artist, or manager. P&amp;D is the beating heart of any production whether it be helping set up a black box production at the PAC or carting supplies to off-campus plays and musicals, they are essential to the success of CSArts. Crew-Lympics is a way to celebrate their skills and accomplishments so make sure to purchase a ticket if you can! "

Not only did the students at CSArts love to perform, the crowd loved it too! It was a chance to appreciate that elective classes are great opportunities to learn, and to show what they had been working on all year! Students in non-performing conservatories were able to feel the adrenaline rush of walking on stage–lights flashing, crowds clapping–something they normally wouldn’t do. After the show is completed, students in non-performing conservatories get experience in performing. This showcase gives a chance for students to recognize their growth and achieve an amazing accomplishment after this showcase. Ms. Winans, a teacher who choreographed the ballet elective classes and helped organize the event says, “Elective classes and teachers really live in their own worlds on campus, so this event gives us the chance as teachers to come together and collaborate with each other. ” Her favorite part of the elective showcase is the dress rehearsal, because the audience gets really lively and supportive, encouraging their friends for the real performance. Ballet wasn’t the only class that was shown! There was a variety of hip hop, Taekwondo, stage combat, tap, musical choir, and musical theater! Ms. Winans says, “Elective showcase is such a special event. I also love being able to watch what my fellow teachers have choreographed. Every year, I am amazed and inspired by them. ” Not only does it show the hard work of the students, but is also a chance to appreciate the teachers and their dedication to make this an unforgettable event!

The mural was designed by students, bringing to life the magical ideas of each student. The mural tells a story of what students can create when they put their minds together. John Scane, Mural Painting instructor, designs an annual project to teach his students how to create and design a mural. Then, they work together to incorporate each of their ideas into a finished project. The class, mainly made up of seniors, allows students to build their collaboration skills. At the very start of the class students worked on their own sketches, incorporating their own styles and designs into the final product. “And at the end, everyone kinda put everything together like puzzles,” Sofie Davis said. “We split it into three groups so that everyone has one. ” The class worked together to sketch, paint, and create their beautiful masterpiece before painting it on the wall beside the CSArts postcard mural. Mural Painting gives students the opportunity to learn how to collaborate to bring a magnificent creation to life. Through expressing their different viewpoints, art styles, and creative thinking, students learn life skills before they go out into the world. If you pass by a mural anywhere around the school, take a look at it. Think about how it makes you feel, as well as what it’s truly about. Cherish the memories, the artists’ perspective, and the beauty they provide the school. "

    "title": "The Harmony of Fitness and the Arts",
    "body": "2025/05/16 - Last week, slips were delivered to the classrooms of freshman students informing them of their schedules for the fitness tests happening from May 13 - May 16. The fitness tests are state-mandated and issued to freshmen, along with diagnostics, mental health checks, and other student surveys often given to students throughout the year. The Physical Fitness Tests assess five different categories: Aerobic Capacity (PACER Test), Abdominal Strength and Endurance (Sit-Ups), Trunk Extensor Strength and Flexibility (Trunk Lift), Upper Body Strength and Endurance (Push-Ups), and Flexibility (Back-Saver Sit and Reach, Shoulder Stretch). 5th, 7th, and 9th grade public school students are required to take this test. While it does not affect your GPA or transcript, it is important to participate in these tests for students, parents, and staff to better understand the needs of students. According to a CSArtisan survey out of 16 students, 8 students felt nervous yet somewhat excited about the tests, 3 students were indifferent to it, 4 students felt extremely negative about it, and 1 student was extremely excited about it. Students were also asked if they think fitness and being in shape is important, especially while attending conservatory. “I feel like it’s not that important. ” says Ysa Alcisto, a freshman in Visual Arts, “You’re going to this specific school and you’re already focusing on the arts. It’s kind of hard for the student to have two things going on at once. Keeping in shape and practicing good habits are helpful, but I think it’s up to the student. ” Other students have similar responses. “Sometimes it’s difficult to fit into my schedule with conservatory and everything, but it does help me keep myself in a good headspace,” says Temujin Bachman-Williams, a freshman in Visual Arts. “Fitness is important but I think school is more important,” agrees Ari Dawson, a freshman in Creative Writing. A handful of students, however, believe that fitness is a large, significant part of mastering the arts. “I do think it’s important to engage in fitness while honing your craft… fitness and art are similar,” says Sylvie Brinson, a sophomore in Acting. “Mentally and physically, they take time to perfect and you really have to work for your goal. No discipline means no results, for both fitness and art. ” Seamus McGarry, a freshman in Visual Arts, adds, “I think participating in fitness while doing the arts is super important. I exercise mainly because a healthy body and physical activity are key to a healthy mind. Fitness helps to motivate you to make art and lets you be loose and expressive when making art. It’s one of the best things you can do for yourself. ” Students with chronic illnesses have also agreed that even taking a short walk outside or doing light exercise in the gym can improve your physical and mental wellbeing, even aiding in familial ties. Dancers agree that conditioning and practice improves their performance as well. Other ways to improve your fitness according to students include: participating in the large plethora of physical education classes at our school, doing cardio like running, hiking, walking, swimming, joining a sport outside of school, working out at the gym or at home with calisthenics, resistance and endurance training, and building muscle. Though CSArts is an arts-centered school, this does not mean that fitness should be viewed as an entirely foreign concept. Being in shape impacts every aspect of your life, and even putting a little more effort into being physically active can be valuable. "

For many students, this time marks the beginning of a bittersweet goodbye to senior friends who have become like family. With graduation only 8 days away, emotions are running high. Senior Abigail Risdon reflected on her final weeks of high school, saying, “I’m going to miss my time so much here. I’ve made so many amazing friends and so many amazing memories. I truly could not have asked for a better community than the one I’ve found at CSArts. ” Goodbyes are not only difficult for the seniors preparing to walk across the stage, but also for the teachers who have watched them grow. “It’s exciting and sad to see them go,” said Caballero, a 12th-grade English teacher. “I had my seniors do graduation speeches and as I’ve been reading them I’ve been like, bawling my eyes out. ” Although many seniors are preparing to move away for college, saying goodbye doesn’t have to mean losing touch. In an age of texts, FaceTime, and social media, staying connected with your friends is easier than ever. Making the effort to check in, plan get-togethers during breaks, or even write the occasional letter can help preserve the friendships that have meant so much. And while you probably won’t be calling up your teachers, many say they love when former students stop by to visit during breaks or send the occasional update. A quick hello or a thank-you in person can go a long way, and it means more than you might think. So, as the countdown to graduation continues, take time to enjoy these last moments together and remember that goodbyes don’t have to be final! "

The victim’s name and condition has not been released; however, they were transported to the hospital with multiple stab wounds. The Los Angeles Sheriff’s department says it has arrested one person, Antonio Olivera, who remains in custody. According to investigators, the suspect was wearing a security guard uniform, although authorities confirmed that he was not employed by metro. Police say the attack happened on the pedestrian bridge to the train platform. It was shut down for the investigation. CSArts Senior Abigail Risdon said she arrived at the station that morning to take the train, but was quickly told to back away from the scene. She thought it was just normal police activity, but she wasn’t able to cross the bridge. Risdon was then taken to the next station by her aunt because there was no form of shuttling provided. Olivera now faces one felony count each of assault with a deadly weapon and assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. A future preliminary hearing will be scheduled to determine if there is sufficient enough evidence for the case to then proceed to trial. "

    "title": "Learning Curve: Disabilities In School",
    "body": "2025/05/16 - After being diagnosed with a learning or processing disorder, or a mental or physical disability, students often must shift their focus to managing the challenges of their new reality. The constant questions from peers can trigger feelings of self-consciousness and anxiety. Whether it’s strangers asking about a mobility aid, commenting on stuttering or tics, or witnessing a panic attack, these experiences highlight how disorders can create significant challenges for learning and social life in high school. According to the Child Mind Institute, the best ways to support those with disabilities are building self-confidence, finding a passion, and motivation. “Having a disability is just one part of their life, albeit a big part, and does not define who they are or what they can accomplish,” Education Specialist Mr. Nathan Poole said. Understanding that everyone will use an accommodation someday, whether it’s reading glasses, a cane, or a wheelchair can help shift perspectives on disabilities. Rather than directly asking about someone’s disability, which can be a sensitive topic, focusing on developing a genuine relationship provides better support and reduces stress. “Once a relationship is established, I think it’s fine to ask questions about disabilities, as long as the person’ boundaries are respected,” said Pool. If the person is openly volunteering information, asking questions is a perfect way to learn. There are many accommodations for students with disabilities. Using noise cancelling headphones, being in a quiet space, or extending time can support those with disabilities in the high school environment. “People with disabilities are not receiving ‘special treatment’ when they are provided accommodations,” Poole said. Working on understanding and using a calm approach is key to respecting the boundaries of those with disabilities. It’s important to approach sensitive topics with care and respect, ensuring that any questions about a disabled person’s struggles or life experiences are asked thoughtfully and at the right time. In a school environment, fostering understanding and empathy helps create a supportive atmosphere where all students can thrive. "

There are many summer school programs that don’t cost any money at all.  CSArts school counselor Mindy Shiroma explained that the CSArts Counselor Corner website can provide information on these resources. The website lists free summer school programs where students can earn credit for school. The main programs highlighted include California Community Colleges and Opportunities for Learning, and Public Charter Schools. Another key factor to consider is whether or not the school will accept the credits given by the summer school programs. “We will accept anything that is WACA (Western Association of Schools and Colleges) and UC approved,” said Shiroma. If you are unsure if a program is UC approved, you can visit the University of California A-G Course List. If you are looking to retake a class, students also have the option to take CSArts summer school courses. Hopefully, being aware of these options and resources will allow CSArts students like you to earn the credits they need! "

    "body": "2025/05/16 - The Guitar Recital is home to many incredible guitarists. Diverse and immersive compositions danced and echoed through the Church of the Good Shepherd in Arcadia on April 24th.  The Guitar Conservatory and guitarists from the Popular Music Conservatory collaborated to create the Guitar Ensemble and performed numerous pieces like: “The Greenwood Tree”, “Gymnopedie No. 1,” and “Bluey Theme Song. ” The students chose the pieces they wanted to perform under the motivation and guidance of their instructors. The Spring Guitar Recital’s student feature highlights Zaire Franklin, whose time here was defined by dedication and hard work. He has released multiple albums on his Spotify account, “Zaire King. ” He has written numerous songs and collaborated with many other students at CSArts. Inspired by a book about Bob Marley and the healing attributes of Marley’s music and expressionism, he has spent 5 to 6 years honing his skills.  “I had an old right-handed guitar that had been collecting dust for quite a while, and I decided (after reading the book) to actually try and learn guitar. I picked it up and ended up playing backwards because I was left-handed, but that didn’t stop me, and now I haven’t put down the guitar ever since,” Franklin said. In the recital, he performed an original song titled ‘Velvet’ with Avalon Durand. Since joining the school, he has spent time getting comfortable with a variety of guitar styles, techniques, and jazz, and has now gained an interest in practicing with different pedals and finding new harmonic and melodic routes when soloing. He will be attending USC for Jazz Studies with a full ride. This recital was incredibly diverse, and included: Singing, classical guitar, instrumental rock, bluegrass, Japanese jazz fusion, metal, and original pieces. Students also performed an amazing finale, consisting of songs that three guitar instructors, Miguel Martinez, Danny Anaya, and Scott Johnson, wrote. Martinez wrote “Las Espadas Bailando En La Plaza” (translated to “The Swords Dancing in the Square”). This song is the dramatic background to an intense sword fight. Then, it bleeds into the sunset. Anaya’s bolero is called “Al Oscurecer” (translated to “At Dark”). And finally, the audience became nestled into a navy blue night, freckled with stars while listening to the beautiful Rhumba written by Johnson, “Rhumba Las Estrellas” (translates to Rhumba under the Stars). “I wanted to give the students a piece that felt both cinematic and personal—something they could make their own…Collaborating was energizing. We each (Anaya and Martinez) brought our own style, but stayed focused on the students—what would inspire, educate, and challenge them,” Johnson said.  He expressed that it was thrilling to hear the music that he wrote played by an ensemble of 27 students. Overall, this recital was one of discovery, individuality, and collaboration, and it was amazing! "

In this album, he follows a pattern in his songs—falling in love, only for the relationship to end in hurt. This eventually leads to his last two tracks, ‘Ghost’ and ‘Afterlife,’ which, while showing his surrender to love, also hint at him finally finding something real. But just as things fall into place, tragedy hits the lovebirds at the worst possible time—whether that’s death or a breakup. D4vd’s poetic genius is also reflected in his other albums, “Petals to Thorn” and “The Lost Petals. ” When naming these albums, I noticed that he followed a transitional pattern, from the flowers growing thorns to the petals falling, to the flower dying. Overall, in my opinion, his best track would either be “Afterlife” or “You Left Me First. ” “Afterlife” is raw with emotion and has a nice gothic guitar that fits not only the vibe of the song, but also the vibe of the album. “You Left Me First” explores the theme of heartbreak and broke me when I first heard it with the lines “You loved me at my best, I loved you at your worst. How ironic is that when you left me first?” It carries emotional depth and painful bitterness bound to be on repeat, much like the rest of his album. Wondering when you can see D4vd on tour? He will be in L. A. Sep 20, 2025, on the Withered Tour! "

April 21st-25th was Conservatory Appreciation Week, and although conservatory ended last week, the poster is still up in the cafeteria, so let’s show a little bit more love to our conservatories! The conservatories are all split into different categories: School of Dance, School of Fine Media and Arts, School of Music, and School of Theater. The School of Dance consists of Commercial Dance and Ballet and Contemporary Dance. “They offer so many different styles of dance, so it’s very diverse and you can learn a lot there,” Freshman Makenna Bacerra, Commercial Dance said. “And the classrooms have such a free environment where you don’t really feel embarrassed to do anything because everyone’s just so supportive. ” The School of Fine Media and Arts includes Creative Writing, Integrated Arts, and Visual Arts. Creative Writing is led by Director Timothy Gomez and offers courses in mediums such as poetry, novel writing, screenwriting, and journalism. Led by Tiffany Ma, the Visual Arts conservatory offers classes that help students refine their skills in drawing, painting, sculpting, and other artistic disciplines. Integrated Arts (I. A. ) offers a diverse and interdisciplinary program that encompasses traditional, performing, and contemporary art forms. As one of the most popular conservatories at CSArts, it is expected to welcome even more students in the coming year. “I always let incoming new students know that they should really have an open mind and be willing to try all of the different courses that integrated arts offers,” Director of Integrated Arts Joey Ancona said. “Sometimes you will find new interests in places that you’ve never really experienced before. ” The School of Music encompasses Instrumental Music, Popular Music, and Vocal Arts. Instrumental Music additionally has programs for different instruments - guitar, piano, strings and orchestra, and wind and jazz studies. “I love how expressive and free you can be with your music,” Freshman Nicole Tateosian, Instrumental Music said. “Either if it’s through a solo piece, or chamber piece, you can be as creative as you want. ” Instrumental Music is led by Director Tyler McGeough, who co-leads Popular Music with Director Kirk Averitt. Director Averitt also leads Vocal Arts. “The advice I would give to students entering Vocal Arts or Popular Music as a singer is to make time each day to practice,” Director Averitt said. “You can listen to music, read about an artist, write about how you connect to a song, and of course there is practicing the act of singing. ” Lastly, the School of Theater includes Acting, Musical Theater, and Production and Design. “I like that you can network with working, established, professional actors,” Freshman Araceli Prasarttongosoth, Acting said. P&amp;D is led by Director Adam Roy. Take a moment to thank your conservatory teachers and directors for the hard work they’ve put into your classes!

Students also have complained about issues with trouble refilling reusable water bottles when bathrooms or pipes are offline meaning they have to walk across campus to refill their water bottles, unaware of the orange jugs containing fresh water around campus. Clay and paint from ceramics or art classes have nothing to do with the plumbing problems because our custodial staff regularly cleans those areas. The main reason for clogging is paper towels and menstrual products in the toilets. “If students are caught intentionally clogging the toilets, we can suspend them for property damage,” said Principal of Academics Nicole Read. “We can even charge them the plumbing costs associated with clean up and labor, which could range from hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars. ” The costs of plumbing comes out of CSArts budget and can take away from the expenses for classroom supplies, paper for the copiers, and more.  “It takes away from our ability to save for larger facility projects as well such as additional science lab space, additional bathrooms, and offices,” Read said.  If the plumbing challenges are due to the old pipes, however, they share their cost with Duarte School Unified District (DUSD) and their plumbers help to work on the issue for our school. "

    "title": "AAPI Month",
    "body": "2025/05/16 - At CSArts, May is a packed month with a whirlwind of AP testing, finals, end-of-year conservatory showcases, and a mad dash towards summer. But in the middle of all the chaos, it’s also Asain American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month! So what exactly is AAPI Month about? For some CSArts teachers, it’s a time of reflection, but also a reminder that celebrating culture shouldn’t just be reserved for one month out of the year. “AAPI month is a time for recognition,” said Mrs. Pham, who teaches Chemistry and AP Environmental Science. “But really it shouldn’t be any different from any other month or day. The achievements of any individual and culture should be celebrated at all times. ” She also pointed out that when people think of the AAPI community, they usually think of East Asian cultures– like Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and maybe Vietnamese or Thai. But the term AAPI includes a whole range of communities, from South to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. “There’s such an emphasis on East Asia, but AAPI spans way more than that,” Mrs. Pham added. “Cultures that aren’t always mentioned in the mainstream should still be highlighted. ” Over in the Integrated Arts Conservatory, Mrs. Tan, the Theatrical Makeup teacher, shared her admiration for Filipino artists and how their work helped her stay grounded in her identity. “I really admire several Filipino rappers like Ruby Ibarra, Faith Santilla, Rocky Rivera, Klassy, and Bambu. ” Tan said. “Their music often highlights the struggles of growing up as Filipino immigrants or Filipino Americans. These artists encourage us to embrace our identity and stay connected to our roots. ” One line from the song “US” really stuck with her:“Your DNA contains building blocks made from the mud of over 500 years of resistance and survival. And when you are ready, sis, we’ll be right here. ” As someone who’s both empathetic and introverted, Tan said that message hit home. “It reminds me it’s okay to take time to find your voice. That it’s still valid, even if you’re not ready to speak up yet. When asked how schools can do better in celebrating AAPI voices, she shared that more AAPI representation in leadership roles would make a huge difference. “We need events that reflect our experiences. Whether that’s addressing stereotypes like the model minority myth or offering support for multi-generational households and mental health,” she said. As the school year comes to an end and students push through the final stretch, AAPI month at CSArts reminds us that every story matters! Every culture deserves to be seen, and even in a month as busy as May, there’s always room to listen, learn and celebrate. "

    "title": "From Script to Stage: The Collaborative Process of Mini Musicals",
    "body": "2025/04/18 - The 8th Annual Mini-Musical Festival was a fresh zephyr that came through CSArts– with music and talent blowing through hair and moving the hearts of many. This year, 8 conservatories collaborated to create Mini Musicals. 12 Creative Writers, Dominic Anaya-Gulaya, Antonio Aviles, Levy Butler, Ren Carr, Miranda Cervantes, Ari Dawson, Mariam Ghazaryan, Jonas Hellings, Linhly Harwell, Delight Kim, Sienna Ng, Ada Schmidt, and Jolene Tang, wrote this year’s musicals with the help of music supervisor, writing advisor, and Creative Writing instructor, John Blaylock. Save Junkie, Racing Hearts, Boiled, A Trage-tree, Personal Connections, and Jeopardized dazzled the stage with comedy, mystery, and a wake-up call to serious issues. During the fall semester, writers collaborated and workshopped numerous drafts of these mini musicals, going to the lengths of writing the music themselves. “The scripts go through three or four different revisions in the fall semester…they go through many workshops,” Blaylock said. He said collaboration with so much diversity can bring challenges, but the outcomes are beautiful and extraordinary. No stage production is possible without CSArts’ Production and Design Conservatory. P&amp;D worked with the directors and actors to help bring out the best in the musicals. Students created a black box style stage, which made the mini musicals more immersive and allowed the actors to interact with the audience. The lighting added depth while the props brought the scenes to life. For example, in the deep yet hilarious “Boiled”, a musical where actors personified different types of pasta, like bowtie and spaghetti, to explore themes of toxic relationships, P&amp;D crafted giant hand props that dramatically “snatched up” the pasta characters! It added comedy to a serious topic and was visually appealing. Ada Schmidt, a senior in Creative Writing and writer of Personal Connections and A Trage-Tree, said, “I love music. I love writing music. I always have, and it was fun to explore a genre I’ve never really been in before. ” She said that with Personal Connections, she started with the music and developed the plot with her partner, Linhly Harwell. Meanwhile, Miranda Cervantes, a junior and a writer of the comedy Racing Hearts, said, “My favorite part of writing it was writing the dialogue. I feel like a lot of it was like really silly and it has a lot of funny jokes in it. ” Miranda imagined it as a Grease-inspired highschool romance, while her partner, Mariam Ghazaryan, pitched in with writing the music. The Mini Musicals would not be complete without CSArts’ talented actors and directors bringing them to life. Kristina Miller-Weston, Producer of Mini Musicals and Assistant to the Chair of School of theatre says casting is particularly rewarding. “I love to see, especially with mini musicals, we get to audition more than just musical theatre and acting students. So we get to see what other kids in the school bring to the room…We get to discover new talent, and we get to learn from them, and it’s always my favorite to see the personal stamp that different actors put on work. ” The actors played a crucial role in bringing the scripts to life. Vivienne Pableo in the mystery Jeopardized, said, “Working with the writers was such a pleasure because they are so, so kind, but they were also very helpful with communicating Dakota’s(the main character) motives and her goals to me… At the beginning of the process, we were mostly experimenting with different dialogue and blocking, and I was privileged to see how they shifted certain things and compromised on particular moments in the show. ” Jeopardized was written by Levy Butler and Jolene Tang. Vivienne described how she connected with her character Dakota through the determination she feels when she is given an opportunity for something wondrous, much like Dakota when he is assigned a case. It’s safe to say that this year’s Mini Musicals were creative, compelling, and created memories and relationships that will last a lifetime. "

Straight ahead, there are projected animations, and all around you are pieces ranging from pottery, to fashion design, to photography. One visual artist included in the showcase, Peyton Mata, says, “I have learned many skills from experiencing the many different types of art VA offers to students. ” The 11th grade showcase is unique, because in junior year visual arts students may pick the subjects they study. They have mastered the fundamentals, and now pursue what they are passionate about. This is reflected in the artworks, which were fueled by passion. Peyton Mata showcased a photograph, and a 3D rendering of an environment that they designed. When Mata was prompted about their process, they explained all the hard work and, “multiple weeks and late nights at home,” that they put into the pieces. “I believe my art has grown immensely since freshman year. While I still have lots of room for improvement, I feel as though I have become much more skilled and gone from someone who was still learning the basics to being able to complete full projects,” Mata said.

What inspired you to release this song?: I am a very emotional person. After going through a difficult journey of heartbreak, I wanted to properly process and let out my emotions. What message do you want listeners to take away?: My experience is something that I think a lot of people have felt before at some point. I hope to let others recognize that it is okay to feel this way and help them find some comfort in knowing that they are not alone. What was the biggest challenge you faced?: As it was my first time releasing a piece for the public to listen to, I faced a lot of self doubt. I kept wondering if it was good enough to release and whether I actually wanted to go through with it. How long have you been interested in making music and what sparked your passion?: I’ve been singing since I was 8 years old and really got into songwriting in 8th grade when I was growing through the process of becoming a teenager. Music became an important outlet for me. I also liked listening to music and found lots of inspiration from singers Taylor Swift, Gracie Abrams, Role Model, and Lissie. Do you have plans to release more work and where do you see your music going?: Definitely! I have many songs in the works right now, so keep a lookout for them. My music has a diaristic standpoint so my music will probably be about my life: personal experiences, relationships, friends, meaningful moments. What would you tell other singers who also want to release music?: Just go for it! Make use of whatever you have, record and upload. Music is meant to be fun so even if you get embarrassed, just put it out because making stuff you love is the most important.

    "body": "2025/04/18 - As a student, running a business can seem intimidating, but there are many ways it can benefit you! Navigating your business correctly and balancing your school life is key. Running a small business can give you valuable skills for your future, including career experience. Choosing something that you are passionate about helps make the process more enjoyable for you, and feel less like work. You could sell handmade jewelry, pottery, baked goods, or have a tutoring business. Balancing school work and a small business can be tough, but not impossible. One of the beauties of having your own business is flexibility. Making your jewelry, for example, during weeks when your school workload isn’t as heavy, and then having drops during certain dates is an idea that could help you. “I get to sell it whenever I want,” says a junior at CSArts who sells pottery. “There’s no pressure, and it works with my own schedule. ” Of course, coming up with a plan is always important for your business, but this doesn’t have to be complicated. Simply outlining your goals and marketing approaches can be enough. From there, social media is a good place to promote your business. Marall Tahanian, a student at CSArts had a small business, where she handmade paper blossoms to sell. “It helped me develop business skills that I can use in the future!” she says. She has made her own website and found that it works best with her schedule to run her business during the summer. “Some advice I have for other students when it comes to your own business is to not be afraid to promote your business, and that it’s okay to ask for help,” she says. As your business grows, you will learn valuable lessons, embrace challenges, and gain new skills that will help you in your future. "

    "title": "Rhinoceros: To be or not to be?",
    "body": "2025/04/18 - The lights dim, the incessant French music pauses, and all focus is directed towards the stage as warm lights pour into the black box theatre. Rhinoceros, performed by the acting conservatory from March 27-28, is a play renowned for its critique on the sudden upsurge of Fascism and Nazism during the events preceding World War II, and explores the themes of conformity, culture, fascism, responsibility, logic, mass movements, mob mentality, philosophy and morality. Levvy Butler, a senior in the Creative Writing Conservatory, said, “I liked the style and the dialogue, I liked how they coordinated overlapping conversations and the speed of it. ” At the heart of the play is the evolving dynamic between two characters: the prideful Jean, played by Sevan Cash, a senior, and the kind-hearted, often-inebriated Berenger, played by Matthew Guthrie, also a senior. Their relationship is charged with tension, often highlighted through their comedic exchanges. As the townspeople slowly transform into rhinoceroses, symbolizing the spread of mass ideology, Jean and Berengers’ ideological differences come to the forefront. Cash’s commanding presence as Jean contrasted sharply with Guthrie’s earnest and bewildered portrayal of Berenger, making their scenes especially gripping. The director embraced the play’s absurdity, incorporating dynamic staging that heightened the tension and comedy. The transformation sequences, in which the characters succumb to the rhino plague were particularly striking with the cast’s physicality adding to an unsettling realism to the surreal presence. The most notable and detailed of these transformations was Dudard played by Emma Yniguez, current senior, who’s descent into a rhinoceros showed many of the mind processes of some who may initially resist the herd mentality that arises with facism, but ultimately end up joining the cause. “It was the best senior show I could ever have asked for the cast was incredible. The crew was incredible, which is crazy, because we all work together and like, I feel like every show has at least, like, one or two problems this show, I couldn’t think of any, but, yeah, it was amazing the whole two months,” Yniguez said. Dudard, who is an esteemed lawyer within the french provisional town, used a lot of legal and complex jargon. “When I first got the script, I did script analysis, so I went through all of Dudard‘s lines, and I had to find where the lawyer-ish areas were, because Dudard is a law graduate. So I looked up, like, a lot of laws and stuff like that that related to the lines. And then, yeah, that was really fun. A lot of the words I did not understand myself, so I took about, like, maybe three weeks to fully understand the lines and then just try to be professional. ” The technical elements of the production also played a crucial role. The lighting shifts mirrored the characters descent into hysteria, while the sound design underscored the growing presence of the rhinoceroses with eerie music, moments of loud thumping footsteps, and the incomprehensible rhino roars that increased in frequency during the latter acts. Ultimately, Rhinoceros challenged its audience to consider the dangers of blind conformity. In a world where ideological extremism is increasingly prevalent and continues to manifest in people in positions of power in our country, the play’s message remains relevant as ever. The Acting Conservatory’s production successfully captured both the humor and the haunting gravity of Ionesco’s play, leaving audiences with much to reflect on. "

The yearbook staff has their work cut out for them each year, documenting all the great school events in one year. So how does this book actually get put together? The yearbook class has twenty six students and one teacher, and they spend the school year building the yearbook from scratch. Before the year even starts, they go to a summer camp where they decide on the color scheme, cover design, and overarching “story. ” Then once the school year starts, staff members are trained in: photography, copywriting, interviewing, and graphic design. Graphic design in particular can be difficult to learn, as Mrs. Maritnez explains, “Using a new graphic design software is something a lot of kids need to learn coming in, and even the yearbook vocabulary itself is like a whole new language to learn. ” Once the staff is ready they begin a cycle. They brainstorm ideas for the newspaper, interview staff and students, write stories based on the interviews, and then put the elements together. It’s important in that last step to maintain the theme that the whole yearbook needs to portray. “The theme connects our style, typography, storytelling goals, and making sure that theme is cohesive from beginning to end and it all works together,” Martinez says. Each cycle, the students will produce 6-7 spreads. Since the book needs to be submitted in March, there is an extra cycle for stories that happens between then and mid-April. This small section is then seamlessly inserted into the book to complete it. "

The trip was sponsored by EduAbroad, one of the leading study abroad consultants. The students showed interest in programs that were different from Japan’s, hence their decision to come to CSArts. CSArts students were extremely welcoming to the Japanese exchange students. “We’ve already received amazing feedback from the tour coordinator, and the students indicated they thoroughly enjoyed being here,” Principal of the Arts Dr. Stephen Cook said. The exchange program for CSArts started three years ago. CSArts has hosted students from both China and Japan, and last year a German student studied here.

In her statement, Congresswoman Chu expressed her heartbreak over the devastation caused by the fires and provided multiple resources for federal support including FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) aid, SBA (Small Business Administration) resources, and her own Eaton Fire Recovery Guide, which can be accessed via her official website. Congresswoman Chu voiced deep concerns about the emergency alert system delays for those west of Lake Avenue during the beginning of the fire. She emphasized the need for improved wildfire forecasting and detection, citing her reintroduction of the FIRE Act and ongoing efforts to permanently increase pay for wildland firefighters. The fires across the LA area, including the the Palisades fire would ultimately claim 27 lives and the devastation of the Altadena area has led to the loss of over 9,500 structures leaving more than 20,000 people without homes. “I told President Trump directly to not forget the victims of the Eaton Fire. I am encouraged that he told us he would support California ‘100 percent’ and did not mention conditions on aid,” said Chu in her response, but went on to share that she did have concerns about threats from Trump to place conditions on disaster assistance for the wildfire victims in California. Notably, Congresswoman Chu’s response focused heavily on wildfire mitigation and federal aid but did not address concerns about post-fire mudslides, which continue to impact communities like Sierra Madre and Altadena following heavy rainfall on burn scars.

    "body": "2025/04/18 - On March 20th, President Donald Trump signed an executive order attempting to dismantle the Department of Education (ED). The results of the order are murky at best, but what stands out is how it will affect disadvantaged students. To understand what could happen without the ED, it’s important to understand what it does. It all comes down to money, which is spent specifically for supporting disadvantaged students. Its goal, directly quoted from the U. S. Department of Education’s website is “To promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access. ” The ED raises awareness for students and the education systems who are at a disadvantage. It helps parents and students find efficient and effective means of support. The ED enforces things like 504 plans, oversees federal student loans and provides funding for free meals for students. President Trump’s order plans to “facilitate the closure of the Department of Education,” but this doesn’t mean the department will be shuttered—that would require an act of Congress. So far, no bill has been officially approved for the removal of the ED, although bills H. R. 938 and H. R. 899 are being introduced in the House now. These bills are unlikely to pass as Republicans hold both the House and Senate with small majorities. In the Senate, these bills would require a total of 60 out of 100 votes for passage and there are only 53 Republicans in the Senate at the moment. If these bills do pass, not all functions from the ED will be removed. Support for disabled students such as 504 plans will be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Treasury Department would supply student loans. Still, with the halved ED employees and a possible transfer of departments, there is a possibility for errors and overall there will be less funding for programs. In fact, a specific section, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has had a large cut of employees, from 100 to 3 people. The role of NCES is to keep track of the state of schools across the US. They also supply the information for eligibility needed for Title I, a federal program providing eligible low-income schools with needed money. Almost 90% of school districts benefit from this program. Another program NCES works with is the Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP), which works with rural schools. Both this program and Title I could be and already are affected with only 3 employees left and a possible complete removal. There is a chance that REAP won’t get enough funding for the next school year. Overall, it isn’t likely that the Department of Education will be shut down, but the cut to the workforce and money could have a negative impact on the most vulnerable. "

These final weeks before the big test days in May are being used carefully and wisely. Certain teachers are hosting practice tests to help students feel more comfortable. If you are struggling there are resources to help, but your teachers are going to be best equipped to prepare you. “College board does have a lot of resources but it’s not gonna feel like enough. So if you are eager to really prepare yourself for the test, ask your teacher questions, review your notes, go back to your previous units,” said Vice Principal Sean Kerr. “Be confident, even if you’ve struggled in the class, go into the test and feel really sure of what you have invested your time into. ” While AP tests may be a big deal, it is always important to remember to have balance.

    "title": "Success Beyond Selectivity",
    "body": "2025/03/28 - We’ve all heard of the Ivy League. The eight shiny schools, ever-prestigious and for many, the ultimate accomplishment for high school students. For countless students, chasing prestige can feel like an exhausting all-consuming race. It’s not too dramatic to say that sometimes, one grade, one missed opportunity, one mistake and it suddenly feels like all hopes of getting into your dream college are at risk. So much of the process is hidden behind closed doors. That means it can feel like you are grasping at something that doesn’t exist, and trying to compartmentalize yourself into that “perfect student. ” Is this really how access to higher education is supposed to feel?	Much of the obsession with these elite institutions can be traced back to how American culture glorifies college rankings. In the 1980s, the U. S. News &amp; World report released its first ranking list, designed to offer a digestible hierarchy of undergraduate universities based primarily on reputation. Though initially intended as a simple tool to compare universities, it quickly became a culture stable, fueling a hyper-competitive college admissions environment. Today the rankings are a dichotomy of something influential as well as contentious, having faced accusations of data manipulation and unreliable methodologies. Critics question whether it’s appropriate, or even accurate, to rank colleges on a simplistic scale. And it’s not just universities who are ranked lower that protest. Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and Stanford are amongst the universities who benefit the most from this scale and yet now refuse to submit their own rankings of other universities. The problem runs deeper than just flawed rankings; college acceptance rates at these hyper-selective institutions now hover around 10% or lower, making the process feel like a game of chance rather than a reflection of merit or hard work. Acceptance rates are often manipulated to appear more exclusive through sometimes encouraging unqualified applicants to apply (i. e. sending students mail who might be below their GPA or SAT score bar). In January of 2023, Intelligent. com surveyed over 1,600 current 4-year college students along with those who have graduated from a 4-year school within the last five years, and found that 6 in 10 college applicants lie on their resumes, driven by the pressure to stand out in an ever more competitive pool. Ironically, despite the seemingly relentless assurance from society that Ivy Leagues and the peer institutions have the best to offer, they are not necessarily the best in the world. When compared internationally, many American universities fall behind in terms of educational quality and accessibility. Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland boast world-class institutions that rival or even surpass the most prestigious universities and don’t rely on hyper selectivity or require students to craft resumes filled with endless extracurriculars. Instead they emphasize rigorous academics, accessibility, and affordability allowing students to focus on intellectual growth rather than resume padding. Furthermore, the toll this prestige-driven mindset takes on students is undeniable. The pressure to “succeed” by attending a top tier college has been linked to anxiety, depression, and burnout. Many students become so fixated on a single path to success that they lose sight of the broader picture: why higher education exists in the first place. College is a place of self-discovery as well as learning. Schools are supposed to offer increased job opportunities, higher earning potential, greater job security, as well as the chance to develop valuable skills and build a professional network. Many less selective or lesser known colleges offer just as much, if not more access to all of the above. We need to stop believing in the lie that low acceptance rates equal an institution that has everything you need to not just succeed but thrive. What should truly matter when it comes to evaluating a college is not a rankings list determined by a simple list of data and its perceived sense of exclusivity, but how schools align with an individual’s personal goals and interests. Factors like academic programs, campus culture, financial support, and career services should carry more weight than a school’s brand name. Consider if you are disabled, or neurodivergent, does this school provide good resources that will support my success? Yet the cultural narrative surrounding college admissions often prioritizes prestige over personal fit. Rejection from a prestigious university does not define your worth or dictate your future. While it’s easy to feel like a door has closed, it’s important to remember that countless paths to success exist outside of Ivy League walls. Some of the world’s most influential figures build their legacies at institutions that wouldn’t make it to the top of any ranking list. Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple dropped out of Reed college, Oprah Winfrey, one of the most successful media moguls of all time, attended Tennessee State University, Howard Shultz, former CEO of Starbucks went to Northern Michigan University. These stories remind us that success is not determined by the prestige of one’s alma mater, but by the passion, dedication, and resilience brought to one’s pursuits. Your value doesn’t diminish because of an admissions decision. Coping with rejection is challenging, but it’s also an opportunity to reassess and refocus. Allow yourself to grieve and process your emotions. Talk to trusted friends, family, or mentors about how you’re feeling. Then, start researching schools that may not have been your first choice but still offer excellent academic programs, vibrant communities, and opportunities that align with your goals. Lean into the mindset that success comes from what you do with the opportunities you have, not just where you go to school. Ultimately, moving beyond the prestige myth means acknowledging that fulfillment and accomplishment are not tied to a single institution. The most important thing is to find a place where you can thrive and grow into the person you’re meant to become. "

    "body": "2025/03/28 - Zines are a dying art form, but you wouldn’t have guessed it as more than a thousand people attended the L. A. Zine Fest in Los Angeles March 1st and 2nd. Zines are a type of magazine, often created first hand by the artist, and self-published, to display art and stories. This two day zine production was hosted by the Broad, a contemporary art museum in Downtown L. A. More than 85 artists shared, sold, and discussed their work. CSArts is filled with young artists, yet few of them share their work with the world. This is often because there aren’t always accessible ways to put your work out there, and it can be intimidating to share your art. Zines are a wonderful medium with which to put art out there, and explore other artist’s work. Mel Henderson, one of the artists and print-shop owners at this event, explains what made her start making zines and sharing her work, saying, “Your art is going to be loved by somebody, it’s all about finding your people. I would just encourage anybody, if you make zines, if you make any kind of art, just put it out there. ” At the event, there were thousands of different zines. The amazing aspect of exploring all of the art was that every zine was completely unique and expressed something different, yet everything that was expressed was important. There were booths with zines centering around personal struggles, political stances and issues, social injustices, and interests ranging from punk rock bands to childhood dreams. “I’m an artist of several different mediums, so I make prints, I do photography, and zines was just this really magical way for me to mix all the mediums that I do into one. And it’s just so tactical and I’m also just in love with paper, so zines checked a lot of boxes,” Henderson says. Zines are an easy way to express yourself, share your art, utilize different mediums and interests you have, and work with paper—a dying art form in itself. Henderson advocated for the creation of zines from all young artists. She says, “I made my first zine about a year and a half ago, and I just have not stopped since!” If you’re looking for a way to express yourself through art, Zine’s could be the perfect artform for you!

It started with the social media craze around the world with the defacement of keyboards in chromebooks, and has worsened to broken equipment and vandalized bathrooms. Principal of Academics Nicole Read encourages students to read the vandalism policy on the school website. Even though school administration reviewed the policy at Welcome Week and Morning Announcements, there has been an increase in incidents and these incidents have serious consequences. Students found guilty could face suspension, even expulsion depending on how severe the action was. “The school can charge the family for the cost of restoring the building or equipment and labor involved,” Read said. Repairing the restrooms can cause them to be closed for many school days. The custodial staff are deeply impacted by the trend. Vandalism takes them away from important tasks that keep the campus running smoothly, and prolongs their shifts. “I don’t think students understand how tight any schools’ budgets are,” Read said. “This recent spat of vandalism has cost us thousands. That is money better spent on instruction or supplies. ” Administration understands students’ passion for sharing their voices, but they encourage students to use the art they create in conservatory to express themselves. Students can also express their emotions to school admin and counselors, who will support and listen to their needs. "

Students can find resources on student square or check with local community colleges. She recommends surfing these websites during the summer: “Options for Youth” at https://ofy. org and “Opportunities for Learning” at https://oflschools. org. Summer is a time for rejuvenation, but also exploration. Whether it’s finding a job, volunteering, or taking a few online or in-person courses, take time to invest in yourself.

The Acting Conservatory has been putting on smaller performances called Play Readings. These readings showcase students’ acting abilities in a smaller, less professional setting. The performances are made up of multiple scenes that are acted out by the students. “We only had two weeks to rehearse so, a very short time,” said Freshman Araceli Prasarttongsoth, who is in the Acting Conservatory and performed in Metamorphosis. Since the rooms normally used for performances, like the cafeteria, were occupied, this play reading took place in room 301 in the music building. Although these performances are not as extensive and well known, they represent the student’s work and their progress in acting. It is important to recognize all the performances CSArts put on, the big and the small. If you are intrigued by these performances, some of their actors are performing them in the upcoming Season Finale for the school. We hope to see you there! "

For the first time since its founding, the Interact club independently organized and hosted a blood drive in partnership with City of Hope, a nationally recognized cancer treatment and research center. More than 50 CSArts-SGV students, faculty, parents, and guardians rolled up their sleeves, each giving up a pint. Due to a blood shortage emergency across the country, these selfless actions have a large impact. In fact, a single blood donation can save up to 3 lives. “I am extremely honored for the chance to be awarded. I am very grateful that I was able to give back to my community and make a difference like this,” junior Natalie Lanza said. “This experience was amazing and I was honestly so thrilled to be part of it. Taking the initiative to do good is very important to me,” junior Marley Lemaire said. As the Interact Club goes forward, members are committed to furthering their impact with new fundraising efforts, partnerships, and volunteer opportunities. They emphasize the importance of upholding their values of “Service Above Self,” every step of the way. "

Whether they are the spawn of gods or couch potatoes, felines love respect, laser beams, and catnip. Today is “National Respect Your Cat Day. ” This feline-loving CSArtisan Journalist spoke with four other cat owners on how they honor their cat, and what they’d say to them if they could understand. “Morris is an 11 year old American Shorthair. He isn’t all that smart, but is such an extroverted, gentle cat. He’s also very, very, big. He’s very picky about his food and environment and requires a certain brand of pretty much everything, so we respect that to the best of our ability. Not to be corny, but I’d tell him that we love him very much. ” said Jane Kistner, freshman, Creative Writing conservatory. “My cat’s name is Ollie. He’s a tuxedo cat and is 2. 5 years old. He is super friendly and is active. I show love and respect to my cat by taking photos of him and playing with him, and giving him lots of attention. I would like to say to my cat thank you for peeing in the sink and pooping outside so I don’t have to clean up after him,” said Lula Seifert, freshman, Integrated Arts conservatory. “Burger is a white Khao Manee and Paris is a Black Tuxedo. Burger is only 8 months old and Paris is 3 years old. Burger is very social and friendly.  He loves to go outside and play with the neighbors, while Paris is calmer and more introverted. I show my cats that I love them by playing with them and cuddling them and secretly giving them treats without my mother knowing to make them happy. My cats are the sweetest cats ever and I am so incredibly thankful to have them a part of my life every day,”said Lyna Chataignoux, freshman, Musical Theater Conservatory. “My cat is named Hannah. She’s 8 years old and she hates being pet. She only wants love through food, so to her, I only show respect 3 times a day. If I could talk to my cat I would tell her to shower. ” Ari Dawson, freshman, Creative Writing conservatory. I used to have a cat as well- a gorgeous white and gray Persian longhair. His name was Roko, and he passed away a few months ago at the impressive age of nineteen! He was cautious around strangers, but gentle to my family. As a baby, I attempted to crawl over him and often pulled at his hair, but he never lashed out. He came by our side when wanted to be petted, and cried when we closed bedroom doors. I loved him dearly still, and if I could, I would tell him that I love and miss him so much. My family and I pay our respects to him with a small altar near our stairs, and go through photos of him. Even though he’s not with us anymore, he was one of the biggest parts of my childhood, and I’m sure that whatever afterlife he is in, he stares down at me strangely when I make bad decisions. According to the American Veterinary Association, a third of American households have cats as pets.  That makes almost 74 million domesticated cats! This shows cats are important beings that continue to grace us with their presence on Earth! "

In regards to the challenges, Mr. Read said, “I think the hardest thing is to find the problem to solve, or the concept. ” Ada said her toughest challenges were with the genuine code. “I didn’t know any Javascript (which is what I used to code the app) so I had to teach myself little by little.

    "body": "2025/03/28 - Many CSArts students are eager to work, whether it’s to gain experience, save money for college, help their families, or look for a source of income before they go out into the world. Before they can legally work, students must fill out and obtain a work permit from their schools. It’s a necessary step to ensure balance with academic and work responsibilities. Work permits are required for students under 18, in order to protect them under California labor laws. The permits regulate hours, types of jobs, and compliance requirements while safeguarding academic success and well-being. Younger students, under the age of 16, face stricter regulations to prevent job-related exploitation and excessive workloads. According to paperwork shared by CSArts’ Director of Attendance Monica Bolton, students must “obtain a job first before getting a work permit and have satisfactory grades and attendance records. ” Bolton also said that students must be older than 14 and provide the name, address, and phone number of their employer, as well as their supervisors’ name. Processing of the work permit application can take up to a week. Some students at CSArts aren’t interested in jobs because of the long school hours, distance, and driving restrictions. “I’m not old enough to drive so I can only bike to places. But I’m not going to bike to go super far every single day after conservatory. I can’t really manage that,” Freshman Kalyan Mukhopadhyay said. Teachers have noticed the stress students are under with academics and their job. “It takes a lot of energy to focus on both working and balancing the studies,” Social Sciences teacher Michael Turf said. Many students, however, are searching for a sense of freedom and cash. “I want a job because I want to experience working and getting my own money,” Freshman Kristina Ghazaryan said. “I also want to contribute to my family’s finances like electricity bills to get a feeling of what it’s like. ” No matter your standpoint with obtaining jobs, knowing our school’s job permit requirements and steps is not only important, it’s the law.

Integrated Arts put on the production in the PAC January 27th to February 1st. The CSArtisan talked to some talented students and the IA director on their thoughts and experiences on bringing this phenomenal show to life. “A big challenge on stage was during Act II. Cinderella (Sara Fitzrandolph) dislocated her knee, so we had to adjust the blocking,” said Cami Macias (Little Red). “Even with the injury, she gave an amazing performance. It was tough seeing that happen, but I’m so proud of her and grateful to have worked with her. ” Shane Taylor, who performed as the Dance Captain and as an Ensemble member, said his favorite scene to perform was the Prologue of Act I. “I loved being able to do each different dance part, and I liked the music that I was dancing to and the people I was doing it with. We spent a lot of time on that number, and I feel like it has a special place in my heart now. ” Meanwhile, the technical side of the show brought its own set of challenges. Gabriel Ewan, a member of the crew for Woods, said that taking down the beanstalk without being seen was tricky. Pianist Nicole Lebaron said that playing live music came with its own pressures. “The biggest challenge was handling those little moments when mistakes happened. But overall, the show went really smoothly, and I’m proud of how we pulled everything together!” IA Director and Producer of Into the Woods, Joey Ancona, shared the vision that brought Into the Woods to life. “While it already has dark elements, we aimed to amplify the atmosphere with more dance, a stronger ‘creepy’ vibe, and an overall immersive experience,” he said. Inspired by Tim Burton, the team incorporated his signature style into every detail from costumes and makeup to hair and set design. More than just a performance, Ancona hopes the show left a lasting impact on both the cast and audience. “My hope is that the CSArts community eagerly anticipates our IA show each year, knowing it will always be fresh, exciting, and creatively inspiring. They put in so much hard work and formed such a strong bond— there were plenty of tears on closing night,” he shared. “But more than anything, I hope they feel a deep sense of pride in themselves and in their conservatory. ” With yet another unforgettable production, Integrated Arts continues to push creative boundaries and leave audiences in eager anticipation. If Into the Woods proved anything, it’s that the magic of storytelling— combined with passion, talent, and innovation—can make for an unforgettable night at the Performing Arts Center. "

    "title": "Don’t Take the Bait: Phishing Scams",
    "body": "2025/03/28 - If you check your school inbox often, you may have seen an email from a “classmate” inviting you to collaborate on a document. At first glance, it seems harmless, but clicking the link would’ve taken you to a fraudulent page asking for details, like your school login credentials. This email was actually the most recent example of a phishing attempt faced by CSArts, a deceptive tactic used by cybercriminals to steal personal data. Understanding phishing is crucial, especially when an estimated 46% of all email traffic is spam, much of which contains malicious content like the example above. Phishing is a tactic used by cybercriminals to gain access to sensitive information such as passwords, Social Security numbers, addresses, and banking details. More advanced scams can even install malware on a victim’s device. While some scams can be harder to spot than others, there are some precautions that may protect you from falling victim to an attack. “The best thing to do is take your time,” says Asa Merrigan, CSArts’ tech support. “Scammers often try to rush you by using phrases like ‘Immediate action required!’ so you overlook red flags. ” He advises verifying the sender’s email address, stating that, “Scammers may claim to be from Amazon, but their email address might be a random string of letters and numbers. ” Other telltale signs include poor spelling and grammar, which can indicate a fraudulent message. Many CSArts upperclassmen may have noticed an increase in phishing attempts compared to when they were underclassmen, and there’s a reason for that. “Technology is always evolving, and that means network security can sometimes be compromised,” said Merrigan. “If attackers find a new way to access a system or discover a loophole, they can exploit it to send out phishing scams. ” Phishing attacks on schools are becoming increasingly common. A study reported by NPR found that 108 U. S. school districts fell victim to phishing scams in 2023 alone. These attacks not only cause stress and disrupt normal operations but can also lead to significant financial losses for school districts. Some of the most severe cases escalate into ransomware attacks, where cybercriminals gain access to a school’s network and hold it “hostage,” demanding a ransom for its release. While large-scale ransomware attacks have occurred in some districts, they are still rare. Merrigan reassures that CSArts is more likely to experience smaller email scams, like the ones students have already encountered. “If a student clicks on a phishing link, they will probably only have to worry about changing a few passwords,” he said, encouraging any students who believe they’ve fallen victim to a scam to visit him in his office for assistance. As phishing scams become more sophisticated, it’s crucial for students to stay vigilant and proactive in protecting their information. Cybercriminals rely on deception and urgency to trick victims, but by taking simple precautions such as verifying senders, avoiding suspicious links, and staying informed, students can reduce the risk of falling for these scams. CSArts is constantly working to improve cybersecurity measures, but individual awareness remains the best defense. By recognizing the warning signs and reporting suspicious activity to Tech support, students can help prevent phishing attempts from spreading and protect not only themselves but also their peers and the school community. As Merrigan emphasized, if you ever suspect you’ve been targeted, don’t panic! Seek help, change compromised passwords, and learn from the experience. In a digital world where cyber threats are always evolving, staying cautious and informed is the key to staying safe. "

Sugar Pine is the Creative Writing Conservatory’s annual literary journal. It began when CSArts was first established in 2017, founded by the former Creative Writing Director John Blaylock. The book was named after a type of pine tree common to the San Gabriel Valley area. Creative Writing Director Timothy Gomez currently oversees Sugar Pine. Sugar Pine is made up of fifteen people this year. Students spend long hours creating the literary journal, beginning with submissions in December to final publication in May. Senior Dominic Anaya Gulaya is Editor in Chief this year, while Gomez acts as the adviser. Students serve in many roles: main editors for prose and poetry, the layout lead who decides what the book looks like, and readers and editors. During the process of reviewing submissions for the book, the readers and editors will look over a portion of the pieces submitted before getting together and debating whether to include a piece or not, making Sugar Pine a very collaborative process. Sugar Pine does not make any money, as printing costs are high. Infact, the goal is to actually break even. Donations from parents help with the cost, and whatever profit is made from sales, is sent back into the Creative Writing budget. The long-awaited launch of this year’s Sugar Pine is during the sixth Open Mic Night for Creative Writing, Thursday, May 22nd. "

    "body": "2025/03/28 - Like any tool, AI can help or hurt you depending on how you use it. At school, there are boundaries on AI usage to keep you from falling into the trap of plagiarism. Some ways to use AI are flat-out dangerous to your academic career. Asking Chat-GPT to write an essay for you in a pinch may seem like a great timesaver, but the consequences could be serious. AI can interrupt the learning process. You won’t get the benefits of education if you let AI do the heavy lifting. “A lot of teachers will ask students about their work,” said computer science and English teacher Jake Read. “If they can’t explain it, it’s clear it’s not their work or they don’t understand it. ” Plus, some teachers use a Chrome extension for Google Docs called Draftback to check that you aren’t using AI to cheat. “Draftback produces a little video so you can watch in real time as kids type and delete, type again and delete,” said principal of academics Nicole Read. “If all the sudden boom, something pops in, then you know someone copied and pasted from somewhere. ” According to the Student/Parent Handbook, turning in AI composed work as your own, especially without permission, leads to Behavioral Intervention and could affect your overall grade. Plagiarizing by using AI could also result in expulsion from higher education schools. In other cases, AI can help you learn. The AI software Brisk Boost, for example, lets you have a conversation with an AI that will read a document and ask you a set questions about it. Some teachers use this software in assignments. You can also give an AI your study guide and ask it to test you, or a rubric to ask what’s missing from your assignment. Unless you have permission from a teacher, be cautious and ask for clarification. "

The Visual Arts Conservatory designed artwork for the lobby, while the Production &amp; Design Conservatory worked on sets and costumes. The Creative Writing conservatory also created fairy-tale-themed zines to hand out in the lobby and add to the buzz of show day. Before the performance, students go through an elaborate process. “Before we even get to opening night, students go through auditions, callbacks, rehearsals, vocal training, choreography sessions, and tech meetings,” says Chair of Theater, Jud Williford. The student leadership element of the performance is thorough as well. There are student choreographers and assistant directors who are guided by faculty throughout the process, allowing them to get hands-on experience through the entire production process. The All-School Musical is not only a performance, it teaches students collaboration and how to create a space with positive energy. It also allows students to challenge themselves to be a part of a larger cause.

A relief drive, held in the gym, and organized by CSArts Leadership and Administration collected donations of bottled water, food, clothing, hygiene products, emergency supplies, school materials, pet supplies, and art supplies. The incredible amount of support was not just felt by those impacted at our school. The drive was also made available to anyone impacted by the fires in the wider community. “It’s been amazing to see the school come together to support our students and community. And that’s the hope, right? To see students, former students, teachers, and administrators come together and work so hard. We really have gotten to see how much love this community has for its neighbors,” said Robert Blair, a Creative Writing teacher and volunteer at the drive. In Sacramento and Washington D. C. , State and Federal aid programs have been activated and approved by Governer Gavin Newsom and President Donald Trump to assist affected residents and businesses. People who have lost their homes or experienced property damage can apply for rental assistance and grants to cover essential repairs not covered by insurance. Additionally, funding has been allocated to support local and state governments in debris removal and emergency protective measures. Governor Newsom recently requested nearly $40 billion in federal disaster funding from Congress to aid in recovery and rebuilding efforts, emphasizing the critical need for sustained support to ensure affected communities receive the necessary resources for rebuilding and future mitigation. Environmental hazards continue to plague Southern California. This time with heavy rains dumping 3-6 inches of rain on the burn scars, which lost significant vegetation due to the fire. Without plant life to anchor the soil, towns like Sierra Madre and Altadena became vulnerable to dangerous mudslides. According to the city of Sierra Madre’s official website, “Ashy slopes left stripped by wildfires have been especially susceptible to ‘mudslides’ during and immediately after rainstorms. ” Sierra Madre was among the hardest-hit areas, experiencing mandatory evacuations and more than three feet of mud rushing down from the canyon, burying homes and vehicles. Severe mudslides also occurred in regions close to the Palisades Fire, where vegetation loss was even greater. To better understand the response to these ongoing environmental challenges, The CSArtisan reached out to the office of Judy Chu, a congressional representative for California, inquiring about measures to prevent future mudslides, as well as broader concerns about federal relief and the long-term environmental effects of the fires. However, due to an influx of inquiries regarding the disaster, The CSArtisan had not received a response at the time of publication.

In August, CSArts students will be able to take a year-long course looking back with a focus on African American History. The Black History commemoration was created by author and historian Carter Godwin Woodson in 1926. It started with just a week. Then in 1976, President Gerald Ford designated the entire month of February as “Black History Month. ” “February is a time where you can hear voices that are usually unheard. As an African American, it feels like acceptance in society,” sophomore Austin Ewing said. Advanced Placement (AP) African American Studies, a new CSArts-SGV history course, is an opportunity to take a deeper dive into the history of African Americans in the US. By including more recent history, the course is more representative of where society is today. According to CollegeBoard, students learn everything from “Early African kingdoms to the ongoing challenges and achievements of the contemporary moment. ” Unlike Advanced Placement (AP) United States History, the course covers the years: 900 BCE to the 2000s.  The test contains 60 multiple choice questions, 3 short-answer questions, 1 document-based question, and 1 individual research project. Social Sciences instructor Michael Turf will be teaching the course starting this coming August. “It is very important to make sense of the world and understand how it got to be that way. AP African American Studies gives the chance for emotional connection and delves deep into daily life. ” Said Mr. Turf. "

    "body": "2025/02/28 - The Grammy’s are one of the most watched award shows in history, dating back to 1959. This year, with 16. 9 million viewers and 94 categories, the Recording Acedemy’s Voting nominated many talented artists and televised 24 awards to the winning ones. By far, the most debated and controversial award goes to the album of the year, which was won by Beyoncé, for her album Cowboy Carter. The other nominees for the category were André 3000, Billie Eilish, Chappell roan, Charli xcx, Jacob Collier, Sabrina carpenter, and Taylor Swift. Fans from across the world broke out into social media debates about who should’ve won the award. The CSArtisan polled 40 CSArts students to get their opinions on who they think should’ve won best album of the year and overwhelmingly 85% of the students voted for Billie Eilish. The reason? Eilish’s music skews to a bit younger crowd and no one is more popular to high school students than the “Birds of a Feather” singer. “Yeah, I mean, I think Billie Eillish should’ve gotten it. She gained so many new fans and stuff, her album was definitely the most talked about this year, probably the most popular too, even though Beyoncé won, right?” student Sylvie Brinson said. Billie Eillish did gain many new listeners, with 1. 5 billion listeners to the album, and the most popular song, “Birds of a Feather,” having 2. 3 billion streams. Beyoncé’s winning album, Cowboy Carter, had less than half the streams as Eilishes’. But, the amount of streams is not part of the criteria for winning the album of the year. The Academy Voting decided that they thought Beyoncè’s album was the most influential Album this year, and her winning the Grammy is historic. It makes her the first Black artist with a country album to ever win “album of the year” in Grammy History. Plus you can’t forget her win of “best country album. ” In Cowboy Carter, Beyonce honored Black country artists, and Black female country artists who represent the future of the genre. In Beyoncé’s acceptance speech, she said, “I hope we just keep pushing forward, opening doors. ” Beyoncé definitely left an impact with her album and branched out into a genre many people didn’t think she could, or would do. Although every talented and hardworking artist that was nominated deserved a win, Beyoncé’s win unquestionably changed the traditional standard for country music. "

Most importantly, it was a chance to bond with friends and lighten the spirits of many students after the LA fires. "

Students and staff members constantly and hopefully refreshed their pages for a glimpse of their online assignments and work. In the modern classroom, the idea that we are all in a technology trap is all too real. Not only students and teachers were affected, but school phones were down, and websites with crucial information like grades, attendance, and emergency contact lines were unable to be accessed. While this issue can certainly be labeled as a crisis, how can we learn to adapt without wifi and how can we avoid these outages? According to Principal of Academics, Nicole Read, this incident was caused by a person experiencing homelessness who intentionally cut the fiber that fuels our campus. Through an investigation run by Spectrum, they believe that the individual was looking for copper wire to resell, but they did not find it in the fiber. Duarte High School was not affected because they have a separate line. This is the second wifi outage since January. The first outrage was on a Sunday, and didn’t have an affect on the school. Ms. Read has expressed her frustration with Spectrum, but their solution is costly. It would entail installing a back-up line in a different location to help feed the CSArts campus during times of emergency, but at a high cost. “If it’s only going to be needed once a year I can’t justify taking that money from instruction from teachers to prevent 1 day of internet. ” "

While on the CSArts campus, they attended academic classes but left before conservatory started. The Tsinghua students aimed to practice their English by being in English-speaking classrooms, but they also helped CSArts students learn too. In the Mandarin classroom, they participated in discussions with the CSArts students of higher levels and played games with the students of lower levels. Mandarin teacher, Ms. Yang, also had them introduce themselves to the class. “My students get good listening practice when they tell them what they like to do, what their names are, stuff like that. ” Ren Yilin, a student from Tsinghua University High School, said CSArts was the first American school he has visited. When asked what differences he observed, he said that his school focused on memorizing facts, while CSArts emphasized active thinking, “But about the students here,” Yilin said, “I think we’re all the same.

    "body": "2025/02/28 - For students who have been here a year or more, this school year has felt a bit different. Even the smallest change in the bell schedule has caused confusion. But the changes were ultimately made with student safety in mind. The decision came after feedback from parents, students, and different groups. The WASC Committee, Safety Committee, and Executive Leadership also gave important input. The result? Nutrition was shortened by 2 minutes, lunch by 5 minutes, and an earlier end time to the academic and conservatory day. Still, lunches are longer at CSArts compared to most other schools. Other times changes affected conservatory classes (blocks 7 and 8). Both blocks were shortened by 5 minutes. Office hours were lengthened by 5 minutes. That gives students more time to work with teachers after class. With all these changes, the school day ends 15 minutes earlier than last school year. This means that students using the metro will be able to get out earlier while there is still daylight. “All those extra minutes are hopefully helping students achieve more healthy life balance, less stress, and maybe even more sleep,” said Academic Principal Nicole Read. The shortened day also helps the school financially, due to a dip in parent donations. "

So how do we avoid it, and if we’ve caught it, how do we let it go? Numerous CSArts students say that despite the fact that it’s only February, burnout has hit an epidemic level. Sophomores Sofia Wallach and Vana Kojikian describe themselves as, “tired and unmotivated,” and not sure how to get focused again. CSArts counselor Mindy Shiroma advises students to, “set realistic goals, prioritize self-care, take breaks, maintain a healthy sleep schedule, and seek support. ” Shiroma invites students to ask themselves: “What might be out of balance?” Burnout does not often come from school work alone. Students often overexert themselves in all areas of their lives. Ms. Shiroma advises students to pause and self-reflect on priorities (such as sleep, relationships, and down time). She goes on to emphasize the importance of reaching out, “If you need help academically, please visit teachers during Office Hours to assist you with creating a ‘To-Do’ list to help you get back on track. ” Juniors dealing with college applications may have heightened feelings of fatigue and lack of motivation. Counselors are currently meeting with all Juniors for their Junior -Year -College- Counseling Meeting to discuss the college application timeline and process. This is an amazing opportunity for these students to reach out about any intensified feelings of burnout and how to deal with it on a personal level. Ms. Shiroma encourages students, saying, “Keep doing your best work!” Sometimes burnout is inevitable, but students can lessen the effects by reflecting and balancing their schoolwork with sleep and activities that bring them joy.

According to school counselor Mrs. McMillen, the most important thing to look for is balance. “Never have more than three AP or college level classes at once, for health purposes and for balanced classes,” McMillen said. Many students already have a schedule filled by conservatory, rehearsals, and long commutes. A day of three back- to- back college-level or AP classes is often just too much. There are also many new classes available for students. The elective list now includes AP African American Studies, CCC Art History, Crafting Workshop, Cinematic Arts, and Competitive Hip-Hop 4, which requires an audition. Seniors can now take CCC government, sophomores can now take CCC World History, and anyone who has taken Spanish 3 can now take CCC Spanish.

As students move from one grade to the next, the challenges and personal responsibilities increase. Principal of Academics, Mrs. Read recommends holding yourself accountable as a strategy for maintaining strong grades and excelling in conservatory. “Using a time management app or chart is sometimes helpful to see where the hours of the day go. ” Although students expect more fun in conservatory, the work is rigorous and can be time-consuming. “I love drawing, but because the assignments or projects were for school, it felt like homework, like an obligation instead of something I enjoy,” said Alyssa Cho (VA ‘26). “So, I tried to implement things that I liked into projects. ” The big reminder heading toward summer? Don’t procrastinate.

High school students are especially vulnerable, with the darker days intensifying these obstacles. SAD is caused by factors like biological clock changes, brain chemical imbalances, Vitamin D deficiency, and melatonin overproduction. Cleveland Clinic explains, “Brain chemicals called neurotransmitters send communications between nerves. These chemicals include serotonin, which contributes to feelings of happiness. ” Treatments for SAD are exercise, light therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and antidepressants. SAD deeply affects high school students, especially those at CSArts, as shorter days and less sunlight trigger depression-like symptoms, says John Hopkins Medicine. These change mood, energy, and focus, making it harder to stay engaged in school and social life. For teens, effective coping strategies—such as getting outdoor sunlight, staying active, and seeking support from trusted adults will make a real difference. By understanding SAD’s indicators, you can take steps to management before affecting your mental health. Get outside for sunlight, stay active, and don’t hesitate to talk to trusted adults if you’re struggling. Remember, taking care of your mental health is just as important as your physical health—especially during challenging times like these. SAD is more than just a feeling, it should be prioritized and discussed. You’re not alone, and help is available. If you are experiencing a mental health or substance abuse crisis, dial 988 for help.

The director’s goal was to combine the musical with the original book, expanding the story and splitting it into two movies. Over the years there were many issues that delayed production but it arrived Thanksging Weekend grossing $118 million. It was eventually announced that the film would star Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo as Glinda and Elphaba. The casting announcement received mixed reactions from fans. Due to only ever getting glimpses into what was happening behind the scenes, fans were unable to form opinions about the movie itself. After finally getting their first proper look at the movie with a trailer released in May, people had a lot to say. Some complained about what was perceived as heavy CGI-use or changes to the small clips of songs they’d heard. Others insisted that the movie was coming along wonderfully and shouldn’t be judged until it was finally released. But, once released, the movie was instantly a hit, rising to the top of the film and music charts as one of the most successful movies based on a musical of all time. Although others found themselves underwhelmed by the plot and frustrated by how long it was (2 hours 40 minutes), those reviews were heavily drowned out by a surmount of overwhelmingly positive feedback. People were stunned by many aspects of the movie - such as the lead actresses’ chemistry and talented vocals, the vibrant visuals, and the dedication gone into preserving the original heart of the musical. People will most likely be arguing over this Wicked adaptation for as long as they can. Both old fans of the musical and people who have never heard a single song from it will find things they dislike. However, the majority of people seem to have agreed that the Wicked movie was just as wonderful as they anticipated, and are eagerly awaiting the second installment of the series. "

A telltale sign of a scam are websites that require you to pay a fee to apply. During the process of application, Mrs. Christy suggests carefully following the instructions. “To learn how to apply for a scholarship, go to the scholarship’s website or application portal, follow the instructions carefully and make sure to submit by the deadline,” Christy explains. Picking a scholarship that matches your profile is equally as important. “It’s helpful to choose a scholarship that aligns with your strengths, interests or background. For example, if you love the arts, apply for some art-based scholarships. If you love math or science, apply for some STEM related scholarships,” Christy said. In addition to interests and academics, consider ones that focus on personal development, hobbies, culture, and community involvement. By using your passions and achievements your chances of winning the scholarship is higher. All in all, focus on finding opportunities which align with you for a better chance at success and be vigilant to avoid scams.

The students at CSArts and highschool students in general are in a period of expedited growth as people. A common discussion among my peers is the nostalgia of our childhoods; this time of year, especially, we look back at the magic of the holidays as children. “The holidays feel less special and less exciting,” Vana Kojikian, a CSArts sophomore said, “I still look forward to it but it doesn’t always feel the same as it did when we were younger. ” Students and teens as a whole scramble to keep the holiday spirit and magic alive. One way to accomplish this is creating the right atmosphere. A poll of CSArts students shows that over 50% decorate for the holidays the day after Thanksgiving. Another 16% of students decorate even earlier than that. Joy Thomas said, “I like to start decorating a week before Thanksgiving to have everything ready. ” She explains that decorating earlier extends the season and allows you to make the most of this time of year. Childhood holiday traditions are still important to many teens, and help keep the spirit alive. “I watch movies with my family, cook dinners, and bake cookies,” CSArts student Sofia Wallach said, “I’ve done these traditions since childhood. ” She said that, “Receiving gifts and waiting for Santa to come, are not the priority. ” Wallach explains that now that she is older, instead of feeling holiday magic through literal magic, she focuses more on the spirit throughout the month, with all of her traditions. As we grow up, new traditions are formed to go along with the old ones. Wallach has a younger brother, and talks about her new traditions and trying to keep the magical element alive for him. She said, “I would help wrap his presents and try to keep him believing in Santa. ” Students also spend more time with their friends around the holidays. Many participate in “Secret Santa’s,” or other winter activities like ice skating, gingerbread house making, and baking with friends. These new traditions can be just as important as the old ones. The holidays feel different now that students are growing up, but the holiday season is still a magical time thanks to decorations, traditions, friends, and family. "

To honor those who have been lost, people hold events to share their life stories and hold candlelight marches or moments of silence. On the first full day of Winter, December 21st, the day of remembrance is an invitation to remember those who died without a home, and think about what the state and the country can do to help.

Why does our perception of time change so drastically and what is the impact? This phenomenon is known as the Holiday Paradox. When life is full of new experiences, like the excitement of celebration, time seems to slow down. As we go through life, these moments become less memorable. Dr. Cindy Lustig, psychology professor at the University of Michigan, puts this into perspective. For an 8 year old, she says, a week is a significant portion of their life while for an 80 year old, it represents a much smaller portion. “It feels like the days are blending together, which is both exciting and scary at the same time. I remember Thanksgiving and Christmas being such a big deal, but all the experiences that come from being a teen have changed that,” sophomore Katie Chiang said. “You have to intentionally make things more special, especially since the memories of waking up and expecting Santa Claus wains over time,” Journalism teacher Mr. Blair said.

Read shared her advice in a recent interview, offering insights to help students and families navigate this important decision: Tip #1: Start Early and Be Punctual: Mrs. Read emphasized the importance of starting the transfer process early– and not procrastinating. “I would do it ahead of time, don’t wait till the last minute– oftentimes students forget, or they’re a few days late with their submission,” she said. “Conservatory directors really hold this firm line because they believe that your punctuality and submitting a transfer application shows you’re really serious about it and that you’re not just escaping a situation in another conservatory. ” Tip #2: Understand the Timing: A key point Mrs. Read clarified was the timeline for transfers. “A common misunderstanding that families and students have about conservatory transfers is that they think it’s for the next semester, but it’s for the next fall,” she said. “Directors plan budgets based on the number of incoming students for the next academic year, so mid-year transfers aren’t possible. ” Tip #3: Leverage Teacher and Mentor Support: Mrs. Read encouraged students to involve their mentors and advisors in the process. “Certainly all the directors and teachers are willing to discuss with kids whether they think it’s a good fit or not,” she said. Seeking feedback from those who know your strengths and goals can provide clarity and confidence. So, start early, respect the timeline, and leverage support of teachers and advisors.  As Mrs. Read put it, “If you’re thinking about transferring, just go for it! It can’t hurt– find out if you can transfer. Even if you decide not to, at least you’ll know your options. ” "

    "body": "2024/12/13 - With all the hype around Chromakopia, Tyler, The Creator’s newest album, I’ve been excited to check it out. The album was released on Oct 28, 2024 to its eager fansbase. But, does the album deliver? I would say yes! Song after song was different: “Balloon”, “Sticky” and “Rah Tah Tah” have energetic scream-worthy beats along with slower, more emotional songs like “Hey Jane”, “I Hope You Find Your Way Home,” and “Judge Judy. ” Song after song has been added to my playlist, but “Balloon”, “Sticky” and “Rah Tah Tah” have been my favorites from the beginning. I love the playful and comedic lyrics of the first two, and the dramatic melodies in the background of all three catch my attention. In my opinion, other songs, especially “Judge Judy” have been a lot less impressive and exciting. The poll included CSArts’ favorite and least favorite Chromakopia song, and rating of the album. So far, “Sticky” appears to be the most liked song, and “Judge Judy” is the least favorite. “The change in St. Chroma from the trailer to the official song actually made it worse,” said student Plaid Brake. Student Jaxon Jackson said, “Judge Judy is not all that. If I were to rank it in comparison to every Tyler song I’ve ever heard, it would be near the bottom. ” The album got an 8 out of 10 overall. Do you agree with your peers at CSArts? "

    "title": "An Ode to Alien Stage",
    "body": "2024/12/13 - Alien Stage (sometimes styled ALIEN STAGE) is a South Korean music project and animated YouTube series told through consecutive music videos featuring original characters and songs. Led by VIVINOS, a South Korean artist and animator, in collaboration with QMENG and STUDIO LICO, Alien Stage follows the story of humans born into a futuristic society in which aliens have taken over the world, giving rise to the advent of “human pets” forced to compete in the titular game show. It’s often described by fans as “a cross between The Hunger Games and The Masked Singer,” in which pairs of contestants compete against each other through duets. The winner advances to the next round, and the loser is publicly executed in front of a live audience at the end of the song. While such a violent premise may sound dubious, the real magic of Alien Stage is expressed through the dynamics between the seven main characters, all told without a single line of dialogue (bar a brief monologue in the song “My Clematis”). As the show progresses, character storylines overlap and increase in complexity, often with gut-wrenching results, such as the sacrifice of the character Ivan in Round 6, following a kiss between one of the show’s two queer couples. I got into Alien Stage from recommendations by my friends, expecting it to be a casual watch before I moved on with my life. Instead, I was immersed in a world that I’m finding difficult to escape; it’s been over two months since I watched each round in succession and I’m still just as engaged with the fandom and the lore of the story as I was in the first week of discovery. The writing really shines through the beautiful animation and original songs performed by a coalition of skilled artists. I would give Alien Stage five out of five stars. You can watch Alien Stage on YouTube and view a variety of bonus content from the authors’ social media accounts and on VIVINOS’s Patreon. "

    "body": "2024/11/01 - Transgender people are more than four times more likely than cisgender people to be violently attacked, according to a study by UCLA Williams Institute School of Law. Transgender Awareness Week is observed from November 13th to the 19th. The week is meant as a time to remember those suffering from transphobic violence, and a time to appreciate the rich history of trans people. Social Sciences teacher Micahel Turf, is the advisor of CSArts’ SAGA club (sexuality and gender alliance). Turf is also earning his Masters in History with an emphasis on black and queer American history, including trans people of color. “Appreciating the trans community […] allows us to honor the courage, resilience, and contributions of individuals who challenge societal norms and live authentically. ” Mr. Turf says. “Trans people, especially from marginalized racial and ethnic groups, like Black trans women, face extraordinary systematic challenges yet continue to shape culture, politics, and justice movements. ” A famous example of this movement, Turf says, is Stonewall. Fighting for their rights, a large group of trans and black women protested against the inequality of the LGBTQ+ community. Marsha P. Johnson, a trans and Black woman, sparked the Stonewall protests in 1969. The 1980’s HIV/AIDS crisis complicated issues for the queer community even more. During the struggle, Black and trans women supported those diagnosed from within the community and fought for treatment and a cure. In 2024, 664 anti-trans bills have been introduced across the country, according to Trans Legislation Tracker.  The struggle for awareness of laws and violence in the LGBTQ+ community, and specifically the trans community is why advocates created a week of awareness. Groups like SAGA at CSArts continue to provide education, support and a safe space for LGBTQ+ people. If you would like more information on SAGA, contact Mr. Turf in room 208.  If you are in crisis, you can contact The Trevor Project Crisis Line to talk or text at 866-488-7386. "

    "body": "2024/11/01 - What happens when two hospitable old ladies and a twisted serial killer learn that they have something in common? What will they do about the policemen lodging in their home? Will they kill again? CSArts’ Acting Conservatory answered these questions on October 24th, when the theater doors to “Arsenic &amp; Old Lace” opened. “Old Lace” was originally written in 1941, and enamored audiences of the time with its dark humor, wry wit, and near-farcical irony. The play follows the Brooklyn-living Brewster household, consisting of two homicidal old ladies, a homicidal brother, a brother that thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt, and the most normal of them all, a dramatic critic. Their home acts as a lodging place for the old, the lonely, and the ill. However, as Mortimer, the youngest Brewster, learns the hard way, his old aunts, Abby and Martha, have been poisoning these lodgers to put them out of their misery. Even with such a dark plot, the humor of “Old Lace” bordered on slapstick at times, and had cast members running and jumping around the set. According to Karina Alvarez (ACT ‘25), who played Abby Brewster, the script constantly had her “trotting around on [her] tippy toes, sticking [her] butt out, and fiddling with [her] hands. ” Such a comedy requires a talented and experienced cast. The director, Christina Harris, found exactly what she wanted from this show in a cast of mainly Acting seniors. Many theatergoers may remember these leads from shows like “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “The 39 Steps,” or “John Proctor is the Villain. ” “I always try my best to bring all the energy and joy I have in myself into characters like [Teddy], so translating that into Teddy was really just an amazing process and a whole lot of fun,” said Matthew Guthrie (ACT ‘25), who played the pseudo-presidential Teddy Brewster. As with any show, both cast and crew gave their all, putting on a show worthy of an audience, but experienced student designers and a student manager had some extra weight to carry. “It was my first time ever being in a stage managing role, and it was very fun to just be a part of that community, because I made so many new friends,” said Alique Zadoian (P&amp;D ‘25), the show’s student Stage Manager. “The most fun was found backstage, bonding with all the cast and crew and singing stupid songs in the dressing room were the greatest parts,” said Matthew. Classics like “Arsenic &amp; Old Lace” hold up to this day in a theater scene where colleges and high schools are drawn to edgy new shows. Some theaters may insist upon performing hot new shows, but many will agree that sticking to the classics is a fantastic way to honor the history of theater. "

But, If you know nothing about King’s 1975 book, and have never seen the other versions, it’s actually an entertaining film! If you’re in the mood for a chilling journey through the darker corners of human nature and the supernatural, Salems Lot is an entertaining hour and 53 minutes. The made-for-TV movie brings the small town of “Jerusalems Lot” to life, with vampires and even creepy children with fangs. The director, Gary Dauberman, creates an eerie atmosphere, making the town itself a character. The story centers on Ben Mears, a writer who returns to “Jerusalem Lot” to face his past, and ultimately comes face to face with evil. As the townspeople begin to change in strange ways (and grow fangs), Mears realizes he is up against forces beyond his control. Yes, there is little character development, but that means there are no “sappy feels” for the vampires victims. Plus, eerie silences will leave you on the edge of your seat, and jump scares will leave horror lovers screaming with delight.  It’s campy; it’s cheesy; and it’s not going to be up for an Oscar Nomination, but Salem’s Lot does entertain. You can Watch Salem’s Lot on MAX. "

Columbus Day is a federal holiday, but in 2019, The State of California decided to change the holiday in order to recognize Indigenous Peoples across the state. Although students are always eager to have the much-needed break, the holiday means so much more than sleeping in or catching up on school work. Indigenous Peoples Day celebrates and recognizes indigenous communities, cultures, and the violence committed against them during the founding of The United States. To many indigenous communities, Columbus has become symbolic of colonization and the violence that caused chaos and destruction in their lives. It was with his arrival that the beginnings of loss in Indigenous lands, lives, and cultures began. Due to this, Native American activists asked for a shift away from Columbus Day, and since 1971, states like California have, albeit slowly, made the change. Indigenous lawmaker, Rep. Tawna Sanchez, said “I don’t know that we’ll ever get to a place where people have their land back or have the recognition of who they are, to the degree that we need to or should. But the fact that people are paying attention at this very moment — that’s important, because we will have a greater opportunity to educate people and help them understand why we are where we are right now,” she told NPR in 2021. Located at Duarte, the CSArts- SGV campus sits on what was Tongva land, a settlement that long predated European colonization in the San Gabriel Valley. A step in understanding and respect, Indigenous People’s Day acknowledges the history of the indigenous communities who have lived among the lands we occupy in Southern California. "

Let’s start with chocolate. M&amp;Ms, Hershey, Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, Kit Kats, and Mars bars, to name a few, all contain something called lecithin. Lecithin, as explained by VeryWellHealth, is a natural fat found in foods like soybeans, egg yolks, and fish. It is used in chocolate to keep crystals or bloom from forming, or ingredients mixed together (as an emulsifier), among other things. Some of these chocolate bars also contain another emulsifier called PGPR (short for polyglycerol polyricinoleate). According to the Hershey Company, PGPR comes from castor oil, and helps chocolate to flow better. Various studies have concluded that it has no negative health effects. Apart from chocolate, things get a lot more sour–and I’m not just talking about flavor. Sour candies such as nerds, sour patch kids, starbursts, skittles, and smarties contain artificial colors like red 40, yellow 5, yellow 6, blue 1, and blue 2. Surprisingly, the FDA says that these colors, sometimes known as “coal-tar colors”, are derived from petroleum. What about the dextrose ingredient in many of the candies mentioned? As the suffix “-ose” suggests, dextrose is a type of sugar. According to WebMD, it comes from corn and is added to food to enhance flavor or shelf-life. Lastly, a wax called carnauba wax adds polish to candies like M&amp;Ms, Nerds, and Skittles. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, carnauba wax is harvested from the fronds of the carnauba palm plant. So check on the fine print on the candy wrapper before you open it. You may choose not to partake! "

These altars are to celebrate Dia De Los Muertos (or in English- The Day of The Dead) which happens every year on November 1st. Dia de los Muertos is a holiday rich in culture and tradition, celebrating family and friends who have died. Dia de los Muertos is celebrated by making an altar and putting up photos and objects of those who passed away, an idea that you might recognize from the Disney movie Coco. In Mexican culture this allows the spirits of the dead to visit when the barrier between the land of the living and the land of the dead is at its thinnest. The altar is decorated with items like candles, flowers and food to help guide the spirits. If you want to celebrate Dia de los Muertos on campus, you will find an “ofrenda” in the creative writing library set up by Creative Writing Conservatory Director, Timothy Gomez. Although the holiday is known to be on November 1st, Dia De Los Muertos is a series of days. It begins with a day to honor pets who have died on October 27th.  October 28th is a day to remember those who died unexpectedly, or tragically in an accident. October 30th is dedicated to remember those who are in limbo, a plane for those who died before being baptized. It’s often thought that the October 30th celebration is what inspired modern day Halloween.  November 1st is specifically for children and November 2nd is for adults. Dia de los Muertos also holds a lot of meaning for those who celebrate it. “Dia de los Muertos is a holiday in which we recognize our ancestors. With family and friends we are able to talk to each other and reminisce about those who have passed. It helps us understand who the people before us were and helped shape who we are today,” Spanish Teacher Fatima Ruiz said. Family, friends, and faith are the focus of Dia De Los Muertos and the holiday is a powerful way to form connections. "

However, while the use of perfume seems harmless, spraying it in enclosed spaces can cause problems. Students who spray perfume around the classroom,can bring on allergic reactions or cause distraction in learning. It can also be harmful to the sprayer themselves. Many students have allergies or asthma to the strong scents, causing dizziness and sickness. Fragrances can trigger sneezing, coughing, wheezing, migraines, and rashes. “About 30 percent of the population of the United States had irritation from a perfume,” says Healthline. Sensory issues can affect students’ focus in class. According to child. mind. org, students experiencing sensory issues will have “problems related to processing information from the senses, like sight and sound. ” So pungent perfumes can cause everything from minor inconveniences—to health crises. These scents can also create social tensions, so the harms of perfume have far-reaching effects. By being mindful of the impact of perfume, students can help create a healthier, more inclusive environment where everyone can focus on learning without discomfort.

Getting involved helps the community, increases students’ morale and sense of purpose, and looks great on college applications. But how do you get involved? The National Honors Society (NHS) at CSArts has just kicked off, and with it comes a required number of service hours to fill. Social Sciences teacher Michael Turf is CSArts’ NHS organizer, and he poses the question, “How are you making an impact on your community?” Turf shares volunteer opportunities for students in NHS, including peer tutoring. He has posted fliers around campus for interested students, plus you can make a difference right here on campus. Service hours are convenient and available if you tutor students during office hours, rather than take time outside to complete service hours. Math is the most popular subject to tutor. Turf also recommends that students check in with their conservatory directors for opportunities. They often have service projects connected to the conservatory. For example, The Dragon Kim Foundation has opportunities for volunteering with Instrumental Music. Visual arts also has outreach events with elementary school students. KEY Club is also an amazing club to join, as they help you get volunteer hours and are connected to a service based organization in Duarte. Turf said students do not need to be part of a club or organization to get involved in the community. He recommends that all students complete volunteer work, even if it isn’t required for school. “You’re starting to build your resume for colleges and career afterwards, and so how do you stand out vs other candidates?” And Ms. Christy and Ms. McMillen, two CSArts counselors agree. “Whether that’s building your resume for college applications or future employment,” Christy said. The two also believe that volunteering is important because it encourages teens to work with their peers and adults, giving them real-life work experience. It can also expose students to new things and areas they don’t learn a lot about in their day to day life. Volunteer work is not only an amazing way to give back to our community, but it offers so much when building your resume, and amazingly, opportunities are all around the community and here at school.

Mr. Turf has been a CSArts teacher since day one. “I would say the overall energy of CSArts and the range of students–how everyone comes from all over–it’s such a diverse group and yet we all connect and feel like family. ” Turf said during the first year at CSArts, there was no senior class which explains the smaller number of students the first year. With the addition of a senior class and the school becoming more popular, CSArts has grown substantially. “Having small classes was nice, of course, but CSArts has grown so much and it is such a good thing, and I am so proud of the school CSArts is today.

Seniors created their own political personalities and policies to duke it out for democracy in Mr. Skinner’s AP Government classes. Students created their own politicians, including the candidates names, their assigned political parties, specific policies, and of course: personalities! Mr. Skinner’s classroom then turned into a debate stage with an energetic crowd eagerly awaiting punditry and passion. The candidates for block one were Hunter White, Larry Sanderson, Dakota Montgomery, and Ronnie Cash. A student said, “It was really entertaining and nice to see everyone so engaged in the assignment,” one debate watcher said. Instead of just reading about the political process, students participated in an activity focused on what it takes to win the White House. This year’s presidential race brought in some heavy endorsements from Taylor Swift to Beyonce. Students knew the importance of connecting with pop culture in order to win more votes, including which music to play at events. “The crowds went wild for every person’s walk up songs. Each person’s song showed their personality and appealed to the audience differently and set the vibes before their speech,” a debate watcher said. AP Government classes prepare students to be active citizens in The United States of America. Understanding the Constitution, the role and duty of the 3 branches of government, and the importance of a “Nation of Laws” is just part of the class. Pushing students to think deeply about policy and service through debate takes the students’ learning experience to a whole new level, not just preparing them on how to vote, but perhaps, how to serve as leaders in the future. It was a memorable event for the seniors in AP Government. There are more debates and speeches to come! "

    "title": "Bat Boy: A Cast & Crew Perspective",
    "body": "2024/10/04 - CSArts has always been a unique space for the production of unique shows, and this year’s “Bat Boy: The Musical” was no exception. Opening on September 26th, “Bat Boy” offered theatergoers a dark, twisted comedy featuring a terrifying main character, clad in bat prosthetics, greenish-gray body paint, and fake fangs.  It’s a story about a half bat, half human, and how he adapts to society and how society adapts to him,” said Grace Dominguez (MT ‘25), who played Bat Boy’s sister, Shelly.  [He] eventually becomes educated and more intelligent than the rest of the townsfolk and looks to join them in their society. [He] gets rejected by nearly all of them as they scapegoat [him] for their problems until [he] chooses to embrace the true persona of a monster that was forced upon [him],” said Ryan Backstrom (MT ‘26), who played the titular Bat Boy. Grace Dominguez (MT ‘25), commented on the unique style of performance that the show demanded:  The most difficult part [of the performance] was mastering this ‘style’ because the show … plays into archetypes of people,” said Grace. There were many memorable moments in the show. Notably, those who saw the show will distinctly remember Bat Boy climbing, crawling, and creeping around the stage; however, what Ryan Backstrom distinctly remembers was the toll performing like that took on him:  I had to miss conservatory at least once to go to the chiropractor because I was cramping and my neck hurt so bad. There were a couple of times in rehearsal where I couldn’t sing the notes anymore because I had already been singing for two hours on top of having to make lots of loud noises without stopping,” Ryan said. On top of the extraneous performances from Ryan, the show was made challenging to produce because of its generous use of fake blood. Big moments in the musical are punctuated by untimely character deaths, complete with big red blood spots on characters’ wardrobes where they were bitten or stabbed. May Acero (P&amp;D ‘25), the show’s Assistant Stage Manager, recalls having to slather Ryan in fake blood before the climax of Act 2 and how hardworking backstage crew had to mop up said fake blood after every show. While cast and crew are sad to see the show come to a close, they are incredibly proud of the product of their hard work.  I am honestly at peace with the show being over because I feel very artistically fulfilled after this production. Although I’m sad that it is over because I will miss the friends I made throughout the process, I’m just grateful that I was able to have this experience,” said Maisie Brown (MT ‘25), who played Bat Boy’s mother, Meredith.  Seeing my close friends do such good work that I’ve never seen them do before was just so inspiring. It was a reminder that hard work always pays off. And how important it is to acknowledge others’ growth, including your own. ” said Grace. The backstage crew also had a blast with the production of the show, and the design of all of its elements.  This show was one of the best I’ve worked on and I will miss every single element. The smoothie of designs and collaborations was just really beautiful,” said May. And audience members agree that the cast and its amazing pit orchestra of the show put on a brilliant &amp; hysterical spectacle of a two-act performance. Its catchy live band performance left those who heard it humming songs from the show, most of which being about learning to read, loving thy neighbor, or accepting your “beast” inside. "

    "body": "2024/10/04 - While election season in the United States is in full swing, CSArts have already cast their votes and elected co-class presidents. Each grade has two leaders who speak and act for the student body and the CSArtisan spoke with the co-presidents to hear their plans for the year. Senior Co-Class Presidents Charlie Pokaski and Ivy Kim say they wanted to run in order to make sure the class of 2025 had the best leaders and planners to ensure the best school experiences possible. Senior year is the busiest, as they plan all the important senior events like “senior sunrise,” “senior week,” and activities surrounding graduation. Zakai Haynes and Frankie Fontana are the Junior Co-Class Presidents. They say that the process of running and getting elected was a lot of work, but it paid off.  It was an opportunity to help cultivate a positive and unique community,” Haynes said. Haynes and Fontana want to increase participation and passion from Juniors by adding a class point system for rewards. They also want to focus more on school clubs and encourage collaboration.  We believe that clubs are the creative collective of our school,” Haynes said. The Sophomore Co-Class Presidents, Tempele Stewart and Isla Castellon want to set up a student board to gather feedback on certain ideas.  There are a few different roles; some are your typical roles like treasurer and a fundraising consultant. But we also have other fun positions like Food Connoisseur, Voice of the Community, and Communicator of the people,” Castellon said. Their goal is to increase student involvement to change the school community for the better. Evie Linchangco and Kayla Minasian serve as Freshmen Co-Class Presidents. They say their focus is on creating a positive and safe school environment for the Class of 2028.  I’ve always aspired to take on leadership roles, and helping others through volunteering. I truly care about creating a school environment that feels like home, where everyone feels seen, valued, and supported. Freshman year is a pivotal time, and I’m eager to help make this transition smoother for all of us,” Minasian said. The two are also focused on addressing student concerns, including improvements to lunch lines and are working on creating a Google Form to gather student feedback on various issues.  We want to ensure everyone’s voice is heard and that we’re addressing the needs of the students,” Linchangco said. "

June bugs are known for their beautiful green fluorescent shell, but they have been known to fly into students’ heads and hair. This is a new phenomenon at CSArts and the green bugs may be here because of the new greenery on campus. There is a myth that June Beetles are blind, but according to Bugology. com, the beetles can see; they are just clumsy fliers! They are also a great alternative to pesticides, because they kill harmful soil dwelling insects. Yes, with the Beetlejuice sequel on the big screen, these bugs may be getting a bad rep. Yes, they are not coordinated fliers, but these green bugs have a purpose: to get rid of harmful insects. So, “Bee” kind the next time you see one flying clumsily through the air. "

    "body": "2024/10/04 - As we ease into the school year and application season approaches, one term keeps coming up: “demonstrated interest. ” Understanding how to effectively showcase your best qualities for prospective schools could be the key to standing out. “Demonstrated interest” is defined as “the effort a student makes through their college application and actions showing a genuine interest in a specific school. ” In other words, you’re letting the college know the likelihood that you will enroll if accepted. This may include attending college fairs, visiting the campus, emailing admissions officers, applying for early decision, and even connecting on social media. While “demonstrated Interest” is not as important as a stellar transcript and strong leadership, it can be the icing on the cake.  We don’t consider demonstrated interest when looking at applications but it can still be a great way to learn about the prospective school and see if it is a good fit,” University of California Santa Barbara representative said. Other schools, however, do factor in “demonstrated interest” when making admissions decisions. The CSArtisan has compiled a list of schools and the degree of importance of “demonstrated interest. ” If you are interested in a school that is not on the list, see your counselor for more details.

    "body": "2024/10/03 - Imagine getting to class hungry because you haven’t eaten. Stomach growling, you walk into the classroom, and to your surprise: your teacher has a supply of snacks! For many CSArts students, this is a daily occurrence, and many teachers supply items such as granola bars, pencils, and erasers for students in need. Dr. Williams, CSArts’ Restorative Practices Specialist believes that supplies should be provided without question, whether the student can afford to buy them or not.  It’s beneficial because we don’t completely know what’s going on at home, and talking about financial struggles can be a sensitive topic,” Williams said. Williams also said in an ideal world all students would be given supplies at the beginning of the year so they have what they need throughout the semester. However, if it comes to it, the priority should be given to the students who need it the most. In the end, Dr. William says, “If there’s a need, supply it. ” School supplies aren’t the only things that matter in a classroom. Offering food can help students feel supported, creates more of a community atmosphere, and addresses students’ nutritional needs.  No one can think and work effectively when they’re hungry,” Williams said. Currently, the State of California has some of the most comprehensive programs to meet the nutritional needs of students. In the 2022-23 school year, California became the first state to provide free school meals to any child regardless of whether they were eligible for the free or reduced-price meals as defined by the federal government. However, school supplies are a different story. Dr. Williams envisions an educational system where students are supplied with what they need, every day.  If a student needs a pen or a pencil, and you collect it, aren’t they going to need it for the next class? Keep the pen, keep the pencil, keep the paper, take it all to your classes, live your best scholarly life. ” "

    "body": "2024/10/03 - Every day, large numbers of CSArts students rely on the Metro to get to and from school. Many students are aware of the possible dangers that riding the metro may present, as crime incidents on LA Metro have increased over the years along with the number of riders.  So far this year, there have been 2. 18 crimes per 100,000 riders, compared to 1. 2 at this time in 2021 and 0. 84 in 2019,” said Jenna Peterson from Cal Matters. LA Metro has responded to the increase in crime on its trains and platforms in major ways. They have increased the amount of cameras and lights in and around trains. Cameras are used to ward off any criminals and keep track of any active criminal activities. Studies show that just by seeing cameras’ presence, many criminals are deterred and don’t go through with their plans. Better visibility is a great resource, especially on a ride back home at night. Because of that, lots more lighting was added in. This is important for students as we lose more daylight and for the elderly population as the tracks and platforms are better lit. In addition to partnering with local law enforcement agencies, LA Metro has also hired more well-trained security guards to patrol the trains and be on the lookout for dangerous incidents. Metro has also hired more “ambassadors,” who are there to assist those who need physical assistance and are able to report suspicious activity. Another concern is the rise of unhoused people in the Los Angeles area who face mental health issues and who also rely on the Metro. In response, LA Metro created the Metro Homeless Outreach team, which was made by partnering with the Los Angeles Department of Health Services. Those who are a part of the team are set up at different locations to provide essential resources to people experiencing homelessness on the Metro system. These implementations are hoped to immediately increase rider safety.  LA Metro is also looking toward the future with its “Vision Plan,” which is set to be finished by 2028 for the upcoming LA Summer Olympics. While exact details of the plan have not yet been released, Metro’s Vision 2028 released a statement about their project that hopes to: “provide high-quality mobility options that enable people to spend less time traveling; deliver outstanding trip experiences for all users of the transportation system; enhance communities and lives through mobility and access to opportunity; transform LA County through regional collaboration and national leadership; and provide responsive, accountable, and trustworthy governance within the Metro organization. ” It is important for students who ride Metro to be aware of their surroundings and it is never a bad idea to travel with another student. If you have any questions about Metro safety, you can contact Assistant Principal, Leon Metoyer, or Metro Community Relations Officer Daniel Gonzalez. It’s also a good idea to save these important numbers in your phone: CSArts-SGV Security Cell: (626) 205-4001LA Metro Non-Emergency Concern Line: (323) 563-5000LA Metro Police &amp; Security Line: (888) 950-7233 "

We’ve got the info, and two teachers who offered a review of two of the most famous freight fests in Southern California. The most popular are: Universal’s Halloween Horror Nights and Knott’s Scary Farm. Knott’s Scary Farm’s general admission price is $59. 99. You can also get the famous “boo-fit” with your regular admission for $74. 99. Universal Halloween Horror Nights tickets are around $77. Both parks have different tier prices for express tickets. Price-wise, Knott’s Scary Farm appears more affordable than Halloween Horror Nights, but which one is better? We talked to terrified teachers about their experiences this year- Creative Writing Instructor Robert Blair, as he and Social Sciences teacher Michael Turf have already gone to both. Mr. Blair left Horror Nights feeling disappointed and had a better time at Scary Farms.  This year, you’re going to get more jump scares for your money at Knotts.  And that wasn’t the case last year. ” Universal is known for capturing the macabre through movie-themed mazes. Knotts has a variety of mazes with different themes.  I mean they’re both different. One’s a little campier, Knotts is campy, and fun. Universal is usually scarier with props because it’s Hollywood. But this year, you get more for your money at Knotts. ” Blair said his favorite maze at Universal was Death Exposure: Death Valley.  It was like a radioactive desert and there were some great jumpscares, but for the rest of them, I was kinda disappointed. I could tell there weren’t many employees in the mazes. ” Mr. Blair then said that if he could recommend one of the parks for a second visit it would be Knotts, “A lot more jumpscares, and campy, and fun, and a lot less expensive. ” "

Student use of the field during lunch and office hours has been suppressed, due to a staff shortage. Vaping has been a consistent problem on the field, and there have been multiple reports of students smoking. Administrators say that in order to open the field back up there needs to be more supervising staff.  We’re actively looking to hire a campus supervisor, we sent multiple things to try to find someone who fits our school and is talented and capable enough to do the job,” says Leon Metoyer, Assistant Principal. The school is hoping to gain more security, to supervise the field and open it back up. Metoyer says that when they do get more staff, the field will definitely be open. Vaping has also been an issue in the gender-neutral restrooms in the studios. They are also closed during office hours and after school because of vaping.  That is when 80% of our vape sensor detection alarms go off. I’ve been told by students that that is like a place where a lot of people vape. So right now, we’re a little short on staff as far as campus supervisors are concerned, so that area is closed,” Metoyer said. Additionally, administrators added a gate in the back of the PAC.  The gate’s there … to make sure our students and staff and faculty are secure. It’s always been a restricted area, and now there’s a gate,” Metoyer said. Administrators and security are working on hiring new staff to re-open areas where students enjoy spending time and keep our campus safe. "

As the heat increases, coyotes come down from their natural habitats, searching for water and food. Coyotes have been sighted three times around campus in the past several weeks. When adult coyotes are spotted, it usually means they have babies.  What I’ve seen in pictures [of sightings] were small baby coyotes,” assistant principal Leon Metoyer said. Coyotes have an odd appearance. They are the size of a medium dog, but with pointed muzzles, long- bushy tails, and a “zombie-like” walk. They are considered noisy loners, howling and yipping, mostly at night. If you encounter a coyote, don’t pet it (or feed it) since they could bite and they can carry rabies. “The best thing to do when encountering an injured or orphaned wild animal is to leave it alone and undisturbed,” according to WildlifeHelp. org.  Don’t turn your back, get big, make some noise, [and] call for support,” said Metoyer. If you come in contact with a coyote, call The California Department of Fish and Wildlife at (858) 467-4201. "

It’s especially important to be respectful on campus, in a diverse school with people from many different backgrounds. It’s important to be thoughtful about what costume you choose, and if you have a question, run it by CSArts teachers and Administrators. The other main concern is safety.

    "body": "2024/09/13 - Students’s safety when they are at school is more important than ever. Whether that means understanding our school’s emergency procedures, participating in drills, or knowing about recent legislation that affects student safety, students should be informed and prepared. As you may know and have heard, a PA system broadcasts important announcements everywhere on CSArt’s campus.  Before we opened CSArts, this used to be a middle school in Duarte unified. Duarte unified had a hardwired system that went everywhere except for the 400s, and we used that for a number of years, but now we’ve been transitioning to a wireless system, so the 400s can be included. So the fire drill last week was our first real good test of the wireless system, because it was installed over the summer,” said assistant principal, Leon Metoyer. Due to the novelty of this wireless system, however, they are still ironing out some of the system’s issues.  Obviously there are lots of hiccups and concerns, because people heard it outside in the 400s, but didn’t hear it in the classrooms… that’s a concern for all of us. What if there’s a shooter on campus? What if, you know, what if during duck and cover, if there’s an earthquake, we need to be able to communicate inside the classrooms…I’m also fully aware that I sounded like Charlie Brown’s teacher underwater when I was talking,” Metoyer said. To fix these issues, Mr. Metoyer, Ms. Read, along with the facilities team are meeting weekly to ensure that issues concerning student safety are adequately addressed.  I’m working with our facilities team as far as like the physical wiring of that, because there’s still like wiring for the internet that needs to happen. And I’m working with our IT team, along with Mrs. Reed, to kind of go through that whole thing, and we’re probably gonna have to go do like a room for room check and go through everything and make sure it works…I also want to thank everybody for their patience, and please let them know that we’re working hard to fix it,” Metoyer said. On the rare occasion that an intruder lockdown occurs, Mr. Metoyer said every classroom is equipped with yellow emergency buckets.  What’s typically in there is some food, some water, some shock blankets, you know, like the ones you see after somebody runs a marathon… Reflective kind of stuff, and then just some stuff, basically to keep you alive over a long period of time. ” These yellow kits also include medical supplies such as bandages and blood clotting kits. Metoyer wants to assure students that, “…in the event that something like a shooting does happen our teachers have received blood pathogen training” as well as in person training on how to use Narcan nasal spray in the severe case of a fentanyl overdose.  In the future, are we planning to do in person Narcan training for students? Yeah, we’re just trying to figure out the logistics of how to make that happen. ” This is especially relevant now, as there have already been 45 school shootings this year at time of publication, as recorded by the school shootings database. In response, the Biden administration has recently announced new gun control laws and plans on, “…reducing the number of firearms sold without background checks,” according to whitehouse. gov. Biden has also taken initiative on promoting safe storage of firearms, especially in homes. In most school shootings, young adults take guns from their homes because of poor storage techniques. This bill has the goal to pass stricter laws and stronger penalties. If you have ideas or feedback on how to make our campus safer, Mr. Metoyer specifically wants students to remember that they can stop by his office with safety concerns or suggestions, “I’m always happy for feedback!” "

August is the hottest month of the year, so maybe September will be better? While juggling school and extracurricular activities, it isn’t just our brains that are overheating, which can cause major problems. Don’t worry! There are a few easy steps you can take to start beating the heat! Stay inside: CSArts Administrators have added new furniture and tables in our indoor cafeteria area! These changes are sure to be welcomed by students whether it’s scorching hot or pouring rain! Certain teachers also open their classrooms during extreme heat, so make sure to ask your favorite teacher about their lunch policy! Keep Antiperspirant On You: Not all deodorants contain antiperspirants, and they are a must in this heat. According to Mayo Clinic, the main cause of dehydration in heatwaves is due to the amount of water you’re losing due to sweating! Deodorants with antiperspirants can actually prevent you from losing any sweat! Reapplying every once in a while will help cut down the sweating so you’ll lose less water… and yes, it helps with odor too! Drink lots of water/Avoid Caffeine: Studies show that teenagers need 8-11 cups of water a day, and that number only increases with excessive heat. Doctors say that water can help cool you down from the inside, especially if you use ice. Other studies reveal that caffeine can play a large part in dehydrating your body, so avoiding energy drinks is a must in this weather. "

    "body": "2024/09/13 - Starting your first year of high school can be nerve-racking, especially with all the media portrayals of students being shoved into lockers and having to eat lunch alone. “It’s my first time going to an arts high school, so I am definitely nervous. ” That’s a sentence heard on campus from many new students! Yes, CSArts is different than other schools, but different is better. Yes, there will be challenges in classes and your social life. We talked to Juniors and Seniors and they are sharing 5 tips to help you adjust and make your experience at CSArts even better! Stay Organized: Whether you’re new or not, you are with new teachers and different classes. This comes with more homework, projects, and activities. Also, it takes a month or two to figure out teachers’ expectations and grading policies. It can be easy to lose track of deadlines, so develop a plan to stay organized, whether it means getting a planner or creating a schedule. Join Clubs— Explore Your Interests and Build Community!: Wanting to gather with other students who share hobbies or advocate for different communities? Clubs are the place for you! Don’t be afraid to get involved. What you put in is what you’ll get in return at CSArts! Speak to Teachers and Counselors for Extra Support: Whenever you’re stuck, whether with tons of work or you’re needing support, don’t be afraid to reach out to teachers or counselors. They are here to help. Write an email or visit their room during office hours for assistance. Also, remember our Wellness Center in Room 111. Keeping Goals &amp; Building Healthy Study Habits: Setting yearly or even daily goals can better your overall high school life. Similarly, to have those great goals, you can construct beneficial study plans (instead of pulling all-nighters and guzzling down energy drinks). Stay True to Yourself!: It can be hard to remember who you are in jumbles of identities and “cliques”, or what’s hot and trendy. So, take a moment to center yourself and remember there is no one else like you! You’re important, so stay true to yourself and celebrate your authenticity! "

    "body": "2024/09/13 - Navigating a new school year is an emotional journey. The first week, a full week, plus conservatory meant going from 0-100 after Summer Break! Finding classes, meeting new students, teachers, and staff combine for an adrenaline rush on a Monday only to crash by Friday! Even though CSArts days are long, students, particularly new students, are happy to be here.  At my old school, the environment was toxic. I knew some students who transferred due to bullying. At this school, there’s a positive environment and everyone cares about one another. I no longer dread going to school,” said a new freshman. Even with the praise of our school, students are trying to get used to a new bell schedule.  This means shorter nutrition and shorter lunchtime.  Plus, conservatory classes now have an earlier end time. Principal of Arts, Dr. Stephen Cook said, “This year we modified our bell schedule to shorten the entire school day by 15 minutes. "

    "title": "Conservatory at DHS",
    "body": "2024/09/13 - This semester, many Acting and Creative Writing students have made the trek from CSArts to our neighboring campus, Duarte High School during conservatory hours. The main reasons why some conservatory classes are being held at Duarte High is because the teacher-to-student ratio for conservatory classes is not as high as academic classes and the fact that there is not enough room on the CSArts campus for every class to have an individual classroom. When asked why the Acting and Creative Writing conservatories were chosen for this change, Dr. Cook, the Principle of Arts, said:  The classes for this fall semester for these two conservatories have limited needs in terms of specific types of classrooms, like dance studios or music rehearsal spaces. They also do not need specific types of equipment for their classes, other than computers, like Production &amp; Design. ” Dr. Cook also said that this will continue for future semesters. "

Throughout the later part of the week, clubs were set up in the 100’s, 200’s, and the Quad. There are over 90 clubs to choose from this semester! Remember, most clubs will let you just try them for 1 or 2 days, so you don’t need to commit to them until you are ready, so there is no problem with just looking. To those of you who are running your own clubs: remember to be as welcoming as possible to everyone who wants to join and to stay committed to the groups you form. It’s important for you to hold the clubs together because, for a lot of people, the clubs are a huge part of the community. Each day of club rush had a different theme. Wednesday was “affinity and academics,” Thursday was” community,” and today a large portion of the clubs were centered around being social. If you weren’t able to check out all of the clubs, we’ve put together a list for you!
