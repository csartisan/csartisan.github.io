This year, 8 conservatories collaborated to create Mini Musicals.</p>

<p>12 Creative Writers, Dominic Anaya-Gulaya, Antonio Aviles, Levy Butler, Ren Carr, Miranda Cervantes, Ari Dawson, Mariam Ghazaryan, Jonas Hellings, Linhly Harwell, Delight Kim, Sienna Ng, Ada Schmidt, and Jolene Tang, wrote this year’s musicals with the help of music supervisor, writing advisor, and Creative Writing instructor, John Blaylock. Save Junkie, Racing Hearts, Boiled, A Trage-tree, Personal Connections, and Jeopardized dazzled the stage with comedy, mystery, and a wake-up call to serious issues.</p>

<p>During the fall semester, writers collaborated and workshopped numerous drafts of these mini musicals, going to the lengths of writing the music themselves. “The scripts go through three or four different revisions in the fall semester…they go through many workshops,” Blaylock said. He said collaboration with so much diversity can bring challenges, but the outcomes are beautiful and extraordinary.</p>

<p>No stage production is possible without CSArts’ Production and Design Conservatory. P&amp;D worked with the directors and actors to help bring out the best in the musicals. Students created a black box style stage, which made the mini musicals more immersive and allowed the actors to interact with the audience. The lighting added depth while the props brought the scenes to life. For example, in the deep yet hilarious “Boiled”, a musical where actors personified different types of pasta, like bowtie and spaghetti, to explore themes of toxic relationships, P&amp;D crafted giant hand props that dramatically “snatched up” the pasta characters! It added comedy to a serious topic and was visually appealing.</p>

<p>Ada Schmidt, a senior in Creative Writing and writer of Personal Connections and A Trage-Tree, said, “I love music. I love writing music. I always have, and it was fun to explore a genre I’ve never really been in before.” She said that with Personal Connections, she started with the music and developed the plot with her partner, Linhly Harwell. Meanwhile, Miranda Cervantes, a junior and a writer of the comedy Racing Hearts, said, “My favorite part of writing it was writing the dialogue. I feel like a lot of it was like really silly and it has a lot of funny jokes in it.” Miranda imagined it as a Grease-inspired highschool romance, while her partner, Mariam Ghazaryan, pitched in with writing the music.</p>

<p>The Mini Musicals would not be complete without CSArts’ talented actors and directors bringing them to life. Kristina Miller-Weston, Producer of Mini Musicals and Assistant to the Chair of School of theatre says casting is particularly rewarding. “I love to see, especially with mini musicals, we get to audition more than just musical theatre and acting students. So we get to see what other kids in the school bring to the room…We get to discover new talent, and we get to learn from them, and it’s always my favorite to see the personal stamp that different actors put on work.”</p>

<p>The actors played a crucial role in bringing the scripts to life. Vivienne Pableo in the mystery Jeopardized, said, “Working with the writers was such a pleasure because they are so, so kind, but they were also very helpful with communicating Dakota’s(the main character) motives and her goals to me… At the beginning of the process, we were mostly experimenting with different dialogue and blocking, and I was privileged to see how they shifted certain things and compromised on particular moments in the show.” Jeopardized was written by Levy Butler and Jolene Tang. Vivienne described how she connected with her character Dakota through the determination she feels when she is given an opportunity for something wondrous, much like Dakota when he is assigned a case.</p>

<p>It’s safe to say that this year’s Mini Musicals were creative, compelling, and created memories and relationships that will last a lifetime.</p>]]></content><author><name>Mariam Ghazaryan</name></author><category term="productions" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 8th Annual Mini-Musical Festival was a fresh zephyr that came through CSArts– with music and talent blowing through hair and moving the hearts of many.

<p>One visual artist included in the showcase, Peyton Mata, says, “I have learned many skills from experiencing the many different types of art VA offers to students.”</p>

<p>The 11th grade showcase is unique, because in junior year visual arts students may pick the subjects they study. They have mastered the fundamentals, and now pursue what they are passionate about. This is reflected in the artworks, which were fueled by passion.</p>

<p>Peyton Mata showcased a photograph, and a 3D rendering of an environment that they designed. When Mata was prompted about their process, they explained all the hard work and, “multiple weeks and late nights at home,” that they put into the pieces.</p>

<p>“I believe my art has grown immensely since freshman year. While I still have lots of room for improvement, I feel as though I have become much more skilled and gone from someone who was still learning the basics to being able to complete full projects,” Mata said.</p>]]></content><author><name>Nico Deany</name></author><category term="events" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Upon stepping into the CSArts lobby, you find yourself surrounded by various artworks of all different mediums; this is the 11th grade visual arts showcase.

Navigating your business correctly and balancing your school life is key.</p>

<p>Running a small business can give you valuable skills for your future, including career experience. Choosing something that you are passionate about helps make the process more enjoyable for you, and feel less like work. You could sell handmade jewelry, pottery, baked goods, or have a tutoring business.</p>

<p>Balancing school work and a small business can be tough, but not impossible. One of the beauties of having your own business is flexibility. Making your jewelry, for example, during weeks when your school workload isn’t as heavy, and then having drops during certain dates is an idea that could help you. “I get to sell it whenever I want,” says a junior at CSArts who sells pottery. “There’s no pressure, and it works with my own schedule.”</p>

<p>Of course, coming up with a plan is always important for your business, but this doesn’t have to be complicated. Simply outlining your goals and marketing approaches can be enough. From there, social media is a good place to promote your business.</p>

<p>Marall Tahanian, a student at CSArts had a small business, where she handmade paper blossoms to sell.</p>

<p>“It helped me develop business skills that I can use in the future!” she says.</p>

<p>She has made her own website and found that it works best with her schedule to run her business during the summer.</p>

<p>“Some advice I have for other students when it comes to your own business is to not be afraid to promote your business, and that it’s okay to ask for help,” she says.</p>

<p>As your business grows, you will learn valuable lessons, embrace challenges, and gain new skills that will help you in your future.</p>]]></content><author><name>Vana Kojikian</name></author><category term="misc" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a student, running a business can seem intimidating, but there are many ways it can benefit you!

Rhinoceros, performed by the acting conservatory from March 27-28, is a play renowned for its critique on the sudden upsurge of Fascism and Nazism during the events preceding World War II, and explores the themes of conformity, culture, fascism, responsibility, logic, mass movements, mob mentality, philosophy and morality.</p>

<p>Levvy Butler, a senior in the Creative Writing Conservatory, said, “I liked the style and the dialogue, I liked how they coordinated overlapping conversations and the speed of it.”</p>

<p>At the heart of the play is the evolving dynamic between two characters: the prideful Jean, played by Sevan Cash, a senior, and the kind-hearted, often-inebriated Berenger, played by Matthew Guthrie, also a senior. Their relationship is charged with tension, often highlighted through their comedic exchanges. As the townspeople slowly transform into rhinoceroses, symbolizing the spread of mass ideology, Jean and Berengers’ ideological differences come to the forefront. Cash’s commanding presence as Jean contrasted sharply with Guthrie’s earnest and bewildered portrayal of Berenger, making their scenes especially gripping.</p>

<p>The director embraced the play’s absurdity, incorporating dynamic staging that heightened the tension and comedy. The transformation sequences, in which the characters succumb to the rhino plague were particularly striking with the cast’s physicality adding to an unsettling realism to the surreal presence. The most notable and detailed of these transformations was Dudard played by Emma Yniguez, current senior, who’s descent into a rhinoceros showed many of the mind processes of some who may initially resist the herd mentality that arises with facism, but ultimately end up joining the cause. “It was the best senior show I could ever have asked for the cast was incredible. The crew was incredible, which is crazy, because we all work together and like, I feel like every show has at least, like, one or two problems this show, I couldn’t think of any, but, yeah, it was amazing the whole two months,” Yniguez said.</p>

<p>Dudard, who is an esteemed lawyer within the french provisional town, used a lot of legal and complex jargon. “When I first got the script, I did script analysis, so I went through all of Dudard‘s lines, and I had to find where the lawyer-ish areas were, because Dudard is a law graduate. So I looked up, like, a lot of laws and stuff like that that related to the lines. And then, yeah, that was really fun. A lot of the words I did not understand myself, so I took about, like, maybe three weeks to fully understand the lines and then just try to be professional.”</p>

<p>The technical elements of the production also played a crucial role. The lighting shifts mirrored the characters descent into hysteria, while the sound design underscored the growing presence of the rhinoceroses with eerie music, moments of loud thumping footsteps, and the incomprehensible rhino roars that increased in frequency during the latter acts.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Rhinoceros challenged its audience to consider the dangers of blind conformity. In a world where ideological extremism is increasingly prevalent and continues to manifest in people in positions of power in our country, the play’s message remains relevant as ever. The Acting Conservatory’s production successfully captured both the humor and the haunting gravity of Ionesco’s play, leaving audiences with much to reflect on.</p>]]></content><author><name>Abigail Risdon</name></author><category term="productions" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The lights dim, the incessant French music pauses, and all focus is directed towards the stage as warm lights pour into the black box theatre.

That’s a tall order! The yearbook staff has their work cut out for them each year, documenting all the great school events in one year. So how does this book actually get put together?</p>

<p>The yearbook class has twenty six students and one teacher, and they spend the school year building the yearbook from scratch. Before the year even starts, they go to a summer camp where they decide on the color scheme, cover design, and overarching “story.” Then once the school year starts, staff members are trained in: photography, copywriting, interviewing, and graphic design. Graphic design in particular can be difficult to learn, as Mrs. Maritnez explains, “Using a new graphic design software is something a lot of kids need to learn coming in, and even the yearbook vocabulary itself is like a whole new language to learn.”</p>

<p>Once the staff is ready they begin a cycle. They brainstorm ideas for the newspaper, interview staff and students, write stories based on the interviews, and then put the elements together. It’s important in that last step to maintain the theme that the whole yearbook needs to portray. “The theme connects our style, typography, storytelling goals, and making sure that theme is cohesive from beginning to end and it all works together,” Martinez says. Each cycle, the students will produce 6-7 spreads. Since the book needs to be submitted in March, there is an extra cycle for stories that happens between then and mid-April. This small section is then seamlessly inserted into the book to complete it.</p>]]></content><author><name>Salvador Villagomez</name></author><category term="misc" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[All of the memories from throughout the school year, put together in one book?

<p>In her statement, Congresswoman Chu expressed her heartbreak over the devastation caused by the fires and provided multiple resources for federal support including FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) aid, SBA (Small Business Administration) resources, and her own Eaton Fire Recovery Guide, which can be accessed via her official website.</p>

<p>Congresswoman Chu voiced deep concerns about the emergency alert system delays for those west of Lake Avenue during the beginning of the fire. She emphasized the need for improved wildfire forecasting and detection, citing her reintroduction of the FIRE Act and ongoing efforts to permanently increase pay for wildland firefighters.</p>

<p>The fires across the LA area, including the the Palisades fire would ultimately claim 27 lives and the devastation of the Altadena area has led to the loss of over 9,500 structures leaving more than 20,000 people without homes.</p>

<p>“I told President Trump directly to not forget the victims of the Eaton Fire. I am encouraged that he told us he would support California ‘100 percent’ and did not mention conditions on aid,” said Chu in her response, but went on to share that she did have concerns about threats from Trump to place conditions on disaster assistance for the wildfire victims in California.</p>

<p>Notably, Congresswoman Chu’s response focused heavily on wildfire mitigation and federal aid but did not address concerns about post-fire mudslides, which continue to impact communities like Sierra Madre and Altadena following heavy rainfall on burn scars.</p>

The results of the order are murky at best, but what stands out is how it will affect disadvantaged students.</p>

<p>To understand what could happen without the ED, it’s important  to understand what it does. It all comes down to money, which is spent specifically for supporting disadvantaged students. Its goal, directly quoted from the U.S. Department of Education’s website is “To promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.”</p>

<p>The ED raises awareness for students and the education systems who are at a disadvantage. It helps parents and students find efficient and effective means of support. The  ED enforces things like 504 plans, oversees federal student loans and provides funding for free meals for students.</p>

<p>President Trump’s order plans to “facilitate the closure of the Department of Education,” but this doesn’t mean the department will be shuttered—that would require an act of Congress. So far, no bill has been officially approved for the removal of the ED, although bills H.R.938 and H.R.899 are being introduced in the House now.</p>

<p>These bills are unlikely to pass as Republicans hold both the House and Senate with small majorities. In the Senate, these bills would require a total of 60 out of 100 votes for passage and there are only 53 Republicans in the Senate at the moment.</p>

<p>If these bills do pass, not all functions from the ED will be removed. Support for disabled students such as 504 plans will be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Treasury Department would supply student loans.</p>

<p>Still, with the halved ED employees and a possible transfer of departments, there is a possibility for errors and overall there will be less funding for programs. In fact, a specific section, the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) has had a large cut of employees,  from 100 to 3 people. The role of NCES is to keep track of the state of schools across the US. They also supply the information for eligibility needed for Title I, a federal program providing eligible low-income schools with needed money. Almost 90% of school districts benefit from this program.</p>

<p>Another program NCES works with is the Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP), which works with rural schools. Both this program and Title I could be and already are affected with only 3 employees left and a possible complete removal. There is a chance that REAP won’t get enough funding for the next school year.</p>
