With that philosophy in mind, she is stepping into the role with a vision to inspire both students and teachers alike.</p>

<p>Hennessey has been with CSArts since the school first opened in 2017. She was the Chair of the Dance Conservatory. Even after her move to Ohio, she stayed with the school. With Dr. Cook’s resignation as Assistant Principal of the Arts, she decided to apply for the open position.</p>

<p>With a strong foundation in dance, she emphasizes that leadership isn’t about controlling every corner of the arts program, but about trusting the experts who surround her. “I believe in supporting people so they can flourish in what they do,” she said, explaining that trusting each director to lead their programs is central to her approach.</p>

<p>“Sometimes with growth, there also needs to be a moment of settling into them…and really fulfilling what we already have,” Hennessey said. With the addition of the Popular Music Conservatory and the 6th-grade program, the school is allowing some time for easing into those expansions. So, we won’t be seeing any drastic changes made to the Conservatories. Instead, she and her team will focus on improving current conservatories and on supporting Conservatory directors and teachers to provide the best programs for students.</p>

<p>As she steps into her new role, her goal remains clear: to strengthen a community where every artist, teacher, and student can thrive.</p>]]></content><author><name>Mariam Ghazaryan</name></author><category term="student-life" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Wherever art is going in the world, we should be able to provide that for our students,” says Allison Hennessey, the new assistant principal of the arts at CSArts.

<p>The roaches were mostly around the 200s, the Quad, and the cafeteria. Principal of Academics Nicole Read said that the rain and then the pipe burst probably “forced” them out of underground plumbing.</p>

<p>Exterminators spray insecticide on campus once every few weeks. Last month, they sprayed several times in one week. “They did it over three small doses,” Ms. Read said. “We have to be careful not to overdo it in order to protect our students since insecticides can be powerful chemical agents.” The school also has to follow state environmental restrictions for pesticides.</p>

<p>Cockroaches are not aggressive. “While cockroaches can certainly be gross and scary, they will not hurt you,” said Ms. Read. However, an infestation of roaches can cause harm.

<p>There are few people in the world who have penetrated the public consciousness like Jane Goodall has. When she died, it sent a shock wave through the hearts of every person that learned about her brave work. I want to pay tribute to Jane Goodall and all the good she did for the Earth, and what her life encourages us to do.</p>

<p>Jane Goodall first came into the public consciousness in 1963 when National Geographic published a groundbreaking article on her work studying Chimpaneeze’s. Her research on prime apes widened our understanding of our genetic siblings, and brought us closer to understanding our origin more than ever. Jane Goodall would continue working with Chimpaneeze’s for the rest of her life, becoming the official ambassador for chimpanzees all around the world. In her later years, she would go to classrooms all around the world to educate kids on our place in the world and the ways we can protect it.</p>

<p>Creative Writing Instructor and minister of Unitarian Universalist Congregation Fullerton, Robert Blair, delivered a sermon dedicated to Jane Goodall and the Legacy she left behind.</p>

<p>“The woman in her nine decades made so many changes in people's hearts and minds and spirits regarding the animal population, and how we humans have damaged and destroyed much of their living spaces and the environment that they lived in. She is prophetic in the way that she guided a young population mainly, to understand what we have done and how to make things right.”</p>

<p>I wanted to know why she was such a presence in our modern society, and why people loved her so much, and Mr. Blair gave me a goldmine:</p>

<p>“She spoke languages between species, and spoke languages between generations,” Mr. Blair then goes on to talk about the last thing she did in life, which hit close to home. “She died in Pasadena on October 1st, getting ready to plant trees in Altadena because of the fire and getting ready to do her part with younger people, to try and correct what had been done.”</p>

<p>Jane Goodall will always stand in our hearts as a figure of grace, exploration, and valor and a symbol for the good a single person can do. Rest in Peace.</p>]]></content><author><name>James Okon</name></author><category term="essays" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[1934-2025]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/posts/jane-goodall.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/posts/jane-goodall.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">History of Mexican American Music - Part 3</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/history-of-mexican-american-music-3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="History of Mexican American Music - Part 3" /><published>2025-11-21T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2025-11-21T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/history-of-mexican-american-music-3</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/history-of-mexican-american-music-3/"><![CDATA[<p>The 1980s and 1990s saw Mexican American musicians break through into a variety of popular music genres in ways past generations had not. Some of the biggest artists of the era were Rage Against the Machine, Selena, Linda Ronstadt, and Ozomatli. All of whom built on the foundations of artists who had come before them. Mexican American musicians were truly mainstream. Linda Ronstadt, whose career began in the sixties as a folk singer, made the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine as a rock singer. It is challenging to characterize this era with a single sound or type of artist. Ozomatli was a funk band, Selena was the Queen of Tejano music, and Rage Against the Machine was a multi-style band with politically charged lyrics. Funny enough, the different styles of these musicians are in direct relation to artists of the past. At this stage of history, a throughline can be seen from past artists. In this article, I aim to highlight these artists and reflect on their impact on shaping the traditions of Mexican American Music.</p>

<p>Linda Ronstadt, discussed in the previous article, was a popular mainstream artist well into the 1980s. She was a rock singer who was not known for her Mexican American heritage, similar to Riche Valens. However, in the late 1980s, she won numerous awards by finally embracing her Mexican American heritage and releasing an album in Spanish, “Canciones de Mi Padre”. She spoke of the difficulty of getting her record label to agree to produce the album. Ronstandt fought to have it released, as it honored her father and the music she grew up listening to on her family’s ranch. She described making the album as a vital part of her artistic journey. </p>

<p>Rage Against the Machine, although not being an entirely Mexican American band, had a lead singer who was mixed-race and proud of his Mexican American heritage. The band even released a track called “People of the Sun” about Mexicans. Rage Against the Machine, being a multi-styled musical band, can be seen as an evolution of the Zeros and their style of music, as well as their strong ties to Los Angeles. Ozmatlie has a similar relation to their predecessors. In many ways, Ozmatlie does have its own unique blend of jazz and even hip hop; however, it does share similarities with past Mexican American Funk Bands, like El Chicano. Ozamtlie builds upon the foundation set by El Chicano, creating a genre-defying sound.</p>

<p>Selena is perhaps the most interesting and direct connection to Mexican American musicians of the past. She was a tejano artist who was considered equally as popular in the U.S. as she was in Mexico. Her fame was wide, and her music was classic. A strong comparison can be drawn between her and the artist, Lydia Mendoza. Selena was often referred to as the Queen of Tejano music, while Mendoza was believed to be the first queen of Tejano music and a pioneer of the style. Selena played a big role in popularizing the genre. Both artists also had the unique ability to capture audiences in both the U.S. and Mexico. </p>

<p>The 80s-90s were a time of modernizing tradition and building upon the legacies of those who came before. The artists of the 90s found mainstream fame and perfected genres of the past. Without this generation, the explosion of modern Mexican music in the modern era would not have occurred.</p>]]></content><author><name>Henry Soderlind</name></author><category term="history" /><category term="sticky" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The 1980s and 1990s saw Mexican American musicians break through into a variety of popular music genres in ways past generations had not.

This universe takes the stories of the classic heroes we know and love, and flips them right on their back. Following the death of Darkseid in DC All In, the “Elseworld” or the “Alpha World” was formed from the despair and negative energy that he released. This directly opposes the main world, Earth 0, which contains hope and justice at its core. Darkseid’s soul cursed the Elseworld, giving the usual characters in DC different stories.</p>

<p>Absolute Batman, for one, isn’t rich like in the original universe. Instead, he’s a lower class man depicted with multiple different jobs, one of which being a construction worker. This reimagination highlights the intelligence of Bruce Wayne by showing his capabilities in different circumstances and not just when he’s wealthy. When he was a child, his dad was killed in a shooting at the Gotham zoo, leaving his mom as a single mother and taking away from the "nothing to lose” aspect of the original Batman.</p>

<p>Another example is Absolute Superman, who instead of being sent to Earth as a baby, was sent to Earth as a young boy. Kal-el’s connection to Krypton separates him from the human aspect of the original Superman, creating the biggest difference between the two: a lack of his alter-ego Clark Kent. Kal-el is guided by his suit which contains Kryptonian artificial intelligence, and actively seeks perpetrators of social injustice and oppression parallel to his parents’ past efforts to save Krypton from corruption. This Superman is in his teens, making the change from Krypton to Earth more recent and causing him to be much more angry and emotional than the original.</p>

<p>Superman enthusiast Noah Johnson, who is an Integrated Arts senior at CSArts, expresses how he’s yet to read Absolute Superman due to hesitance over the major changes. Although a fan of Superman and the Absolute series altogether, he shares a concern on the adaptations of the character and says, “I still prefer normal Superman because of what he symbolizes”. Nevertheless, Noah approves of the new storylines saying, “Whoever is coming up with this stuff deserves a raise.” Another senior at CSArts, Kayden Hicks, also shows an appreciation for the differences in the Absolute series. “I think it’s the most creative thing they’ve done in a couple years,” he says, “there’s been many spins on characters like Batman, but this one feels special.” Kayden highly recommends Absolute Batman, and says that despite his preference in the Marvel universe, it piqued his interest.</p>

<p>There are many more characters depicted in the Absolute series from heroes to villains. Other popular favorites include Absolute Wonder Woman, Absolute Flash, and Absolute Martian Manhunter. DC fan or not, this series is a gamechanger from the well-known narratives and could be a good read for any superhero fans.</p>]]></content><author><name>Miranda Cervantes</name></author><category term="reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In October 2024, DC introduced a new series called the Absolute Universe written by Scott Snyder.

<p>On Saturday, October 11th, a group of CSArts students, parents, and teachers visited the Bower’s Museum in Santa Ana on a mission: to see the Terracotta Warriors in person. The terracotta warriors are an army of an estimated eight thousand unique statues, built by the first emperor of China Qin Shi Huang over 2,000 years ago to protect his belongings from tomb robbers. Of these eight thousand, the Bower’s museum had five on display–the third ever time they have been displayed in southern California.</p>

<p>It all started with an email. According to Nana Yang, the Mandarin teacher at CSArts, the chairman of the Chinese American Federation (CAF), Fei Pang, emailed her with the offer of free tickets to the Terracotta Warrior exhibition at Bower’s Museum. Yang, knowing how important Chinese history is to the Chinese AP exam, accepted almost instantly.</p>

<p>The trip was split into two parts, including a guided tour of the exhibit, and a crafting activity where visitors had the opportunity to make their own miniature terracotta warriors out of clay.</p>

<p>During the tour, the guide in particular stood out to Yang. “She started her presentation to introduce herself with her connection with China and her understanding of Chinese culture,” says Yang, appreciating the tour guide’s traditional Chinese robes.</p>

<p>But Yang says the crafting activity was even better. “That was my favorite part of the tour– the museum visit,” says Yang. The differences in the handmade student terracotta warriors show how each student views the Terracotta Warriors– and, on a broader level, Chinese history. Yang hopes that this trip has shown her students, even at a beginner level, an exploration of Chinese history, and she hopes that they are able to explore it with an open mind.</p>

<p>To Yang, the most valuable part of the visit was the connections built between the people who attended– students, parents, grandparents, teachers, and CAF members, all coming together to learn Chinese history and culture. However intangible, a bond, a connection is built, with a mutual appreciation for two thousand year-old culture.</p>]]></content><author><name>Jessica Pang</name></author><category term="academics" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A recent visit to a museum introduces students to part of a Chinese army of warriors, as a result of joint efforts between school personnel, the museum, and a private organization.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/posts/none/3.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/posts/none/3.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Lead With Your Type</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/lead-wth-your-type/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Lead With Your Type" /><published>2025-11-21T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2025-11-21T00:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/lead-wth-your-type</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/lead-wth-your-type/"><![CDATA[<p>The CSArts-SGV Interact Club is back with its annual blood drive. Held on November 14th in partnership with City of Hope, the drive is an opportunity for students, parents, and faculty to give a gift that truly saves lives.</p>

<p>“Being able to do something that directly benefits cancer patients is very important to me. It’s inspiring to see how CSArts students continue to impact the community, and we hope to see an increase this year,” said Natalie Lanza, president of the Interact Club.</p>

<p>Blood drives are essential in ensuring that patients have the resources they need to continue fighting. Nationwide shortages and declining donor turnout have made donations more valuable than ever.</p>

<p>“It’s a simple act, but can truly make a difference for the patients at City of Hope,” said Francis Fong, Senior Blood Drive Coordinator. “Even in my own life, my son was diagnosed with leukemia when he was just eight years old. Thanks to the treatment he received and the generosity of blood donors, he is now a two-time leukemia survivor and recently celebrated his 25th birthday.”</p>

<p>Appointments can be made by scanning the QR codes posted around campus. Walk-ins are also accepted. Donors must be at least 16 years of age, weigh a minimum of 110 pounds, provide a valid photo ID, and be in good health.</p>

The small room holds a few chairs, a couple of coffee tables, a love seat, and a desk. Bookshelves line the farthest wall. Despite being labeled The Creative Writing Library, it is, in reality, a supply closet with bookcases—open only during limited office hours. The books are also only available to Creative Writing students, leaving the rest of the school without access to on-site reading materials.</p>

<p>In an interview, Mrs. Read explained why CSArts has not prioritized establishing a formal library space.</p>

<p>“Libraries are very expensive—a middle-tier library would likely cost $500K+—and the truth is that we continue to be significantly underfunded for our arts program. That is always the top priority,” she said. “We work to encourage all families to donate to their CFA as well as expand the ask to our large-scale donors.”</p>

<p>Although research widely supports the impact of free reading materials on literacy, vocabulary, and academic performance, Mrs. Read emphasized that the school is not currently concerned about student reading scores as we already out perform the California average. She recommended that students take advantage of the Duarte public library that is about a ten minute walk from the CSArts campus if they are in need of a book not available at school.</p>

<p>“I wish the school put in more funding to establish a real library. I know where the library is but I never use it because it’s so small and always packed. I think it’s also unfair that it only caters to Creative Writing students,” said an anonymous Popular Music senior. </p>

<p>CSArts has onboarded more students in the past years, so much so that conservatories like Creative Writing and Acting have had to relocate to empty DHS classrooms. In a recent survey sent out by the school, it asked students to rank how they would like to prioritize new additions to the school. Some of the things on that list included creating new office space for administrators. So, why is the focus on space for administrators and not students?</p>

<p>Read responded, “You’ve stumbled upon a topic the admin team and I discuss all the time. DHS has been very generous in sharing space with us and that has allowed us to keep our Conservatory class sizes lower than academic classes. We could keep everyone on our campus during Conservatory, but that would cause us to raise class sizes in Conservatory up towards 30:1 and would mean fewer class options for students. Our ultimate goal is to build more permanent structures on our campus, perhaps on the field.</p>

<p>But like I mentioned earlier, this would cost millions and we are not there yet. But, we’re taking lots of steps in our Foundation and Development offices to hopefully make this possible one day.”</p>

<p>Read said that it’s possible that CSArts could “perhaps,” include a library in the building plans for a structure, but she said,  “all the metrics (school test scores, grade data, matriculation data, LCAP goals, committee notes, survey data, etc.) does not indicate that students are disadvantaged because we don’t have a traditional library. I would be hard pressed to convince any of our boards to divert funds from our other initiatives, when there is a public library within walking distance of the campus. To your point about growth - students continue to be interested in our school, which is a good thing.”</p>

<p>Read added that CSArts-SGV wants to serve as many students as possible, “but you’re right, at some point we’re just out of room. Increasing enrollment does several things for us, namely: it increases our state funding and our parent CFA funding, it’s job security for our amazing staff, it keeps our program working with DUSD as they need support in keeping their enrollment up due to state-wide concerns about declining enrollment, and increasing enrollment brings more diversity to our campus and flushes out the smaller conservatory programs. </p>

<p>Read said the school experiences 4% attrition every year, which means CSArts overenrolls at the start of Fall Semester and then numbers settle by October. “I’m sure you have felt the difference on campus? We started with 1060 and we are now at 1019. While growing enrollment is exciting because it means we’re in demand, stable enrollment is the true goal. Stable enrollment is what big-time donors, grant programs, and banks want to see before they invest in us, and it is those types of relationships that will eventually allow us to build more permanent structures and more state-of-art art spaces.”</p>

<p>I asked the Pop Music Senior how they felt about the increased onboarding of students and the current facilities of the school.  Speaking anonymously, they said, “I understand why they need to add more students for funding but there are so many things that go unattended like the plumbing, wifi, and lack of library for example that it’s unfair to us as students.”</p>

<p>Funding continues to be an ongoing issue for CSArts. If you are able to contribute to the CFA, it goes directly towards building a better campus for all students.</p>]]></content><author><name>Evyn Clayton</name></author><category term="campus" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cramped into a storage closet inside CSArts’ cafeteria lies the school library.

Service, exemplified by the 25 service hours that members complete each semester, <em>Character</em>, demonstrated by following CSArt’s core pillars, finally <em>Scholarship</em>, shown by maintaining a GPA of at least 3.5 GPA.</p>

<p>As for the service hours, many members are part of separate clubs that provide opportunities for service, and the monthly meetings allow members to organize large projects. Michael Turf, the teacher in charge of NHS, also has recommendations about where you can find service hours. “One of the most popular ways students obtain service hours is by peer tutoring. Students work alongside teachers during office hours in tutoring and that counts towards the service hours,” Mr. Turf also recommends using <a href="http://interview.org">[Interview.org]{.underline}</a> to find service opportunities in your area. You can also work through certain conservatories.</p>

<p>Service hours aren’t just for NHS students either. You or anyone you know can collect service hours for college applications.

For sophomore Julia Trinh, that’s far from normal. Trinh spends her free time educating young minds and volunteering at hospitals, speaking about the dangers of drug use and teaching Sex Ed in a safe manner. As a former foster kid, Trinh shared that her passion for volunteering came from her family history, a family member she watched walk down the wrong path and got involved in drug use. Trinh spoke about her volunteering work and the type of work they put in.</p>

<p><strong>What is your main goal for your extracurricular activities?</strong></p>

<p>“Well, I fall under three categories: legislative, school policies, and restorative practice, which is a kind of harm reduction. That’s where I teach people about Fentanyl, overdosage, and narcan. And then I also sex education. But my goal is just to educate everyone on my topics that I work on and hopefully to make a better place.”</p>

<p><strong>What or who got you started in your activities?</strong></p>

<p>“I think, myself, but for mostly harm reduction, which is what I mostly deal with. I would say when the family member did substances when I was younger. I saw the effects of what had happened and I wanted to make sure another family doesn’t have to go through that. Or at least, like, know how to go through it properly and get them treatment. And then for legislative work, this world is a little tough with the laws and stuff, and I think it needs to be fixed.”</p>

<p><strong>What’s your favorite thing about these activities?</strong></p>

<p>“I think my favorite activity within these is meeting new people all over Los Angeles County. We really get to see a bunch of different aspects of lids within LA, especially since I think we all know LA’s a very vast community and I think getting to see that personally is really interesting. And going to different places all around is really fun. I get to see new things and meet new people. So I think it’s really nice to meet new people and then really use their experience and use that for good.”</p>

<p><strong>On average, how long do you spend time volunteering?</strong></p>

<p>“I would say at least five hours a week.”</p>

<p><strong>Where do you tend to volunteer?</strong></p>

<p><strong>“</strong>I work at, I kinda work cause I do get paid for it, Reach LA, which is a LGBTQ-BIPOC nonprofit in downtown Los Angeles and that’s where I do my Sex Education and legislative. Then Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, with the collective of theaters, where I do my harm reduction. So yeah, it’s mostly there.”</p>

<p><strong>What would you want to say to somebody who wants to get into this field?</strong></p>

<p>“I’d say building a network is very important. That’s how I go to so many places. And work on public speaking cause that’s a very critical component. Also, depending on what you do, like what I do, making presentations. It’s also just about having a heart and understanding. Personally, I don’t think you should do it for any college things. It’s a very personal work so I think you are made for it, but sometimes it need to be found.”</p>]]></content><author><name>Pippin Langdon</name></author><category term="spotlight" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Once the Friday school bell rings, most students can’t wait to get home, take a nice warm shower, and nap through the whole weekend.
