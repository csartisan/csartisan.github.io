No worries! The CSArtisan has a brand new podcast: “CSArtisan Talks!”  It’s our goal to give students a “literal” voice and serve the student body with the most accurate information through our podcast! You can find “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0HJcSdDT6CnREdafnh1Ilo">CSArtisan Talks</a>” on Spotify. Look for new episodes with each issue.</p>

<p>CSArtisan Talks gives students a chance to listen to the latest students news at CSArts San Gabriel Valley! Don’t have time to sit down and read the latest news? We’ve got you covered!  In the car, on the train, or while you’re out for a jog!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I get why they’re doing it, but it sucks,”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Samson Khachatryan (CW‘25) said. The CSArtisan interviewed Mr. Metoyer, the assistant principal, to gather further information, answering the questions the student body continues to ask.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before I started [at CSArts], Dr. Endelman had already taken some preliminary meetings and read some literature about the benefits of a digital Hall Pass system. When I began after July 1st… I followed up with a contact to the kid account people, who we use now, to initiate what he asked for,”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mr. Metoyer said.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re keeping students safe and responsible for knowing where you guys are at all times. If there is an evacuation situation and someone is in the restroom, this gives us real-time information about where everyone is. If, God forbid, something bad ever happened, we’re able to go do a better job of trying to protect.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He adds the other reported benefits of the bathroom kiosks, saying,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have received emails from multiple staff members that said students are spending less time on their restroom trips and there are fewer restroom trips. It gives students a greater opportunity to learn.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the school community has been raising concerns about students’ birthnames being displayed when creating a new hall pass. Individuals who aren’t comfortable with classmates knowing their previous names are wondering if there is an incoming solution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re working on it,”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Metoyer said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There’s a few barriers. The system is integrated with our school-wide information system which means that…if it’s not on Aeries, I don’t know what someone else’s adopted name is. So we’re trying to figure out what names people are trying to use…The trick comes for those students who have not been that transparent with their parents and are using a different name. We’re going to try to sample a couple of those nicknames that are already approved to see if they could work and then have a full integration with other names.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another issue that has been brought up amongst CSArts students is the accessibility of gender-neutral bathrooms under the kiosk system due to the restricted amount of gender-neutral bathrooms available.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re still in our honeymoon phase, but we’re still learning, right? So what we’re doing is, we’re allowing the system to allow two people to go at one time, which means one person is in, and maybe one person is waiting for a few minutes, and then they can go in… So it’s a little bit better as far as the transition, you don’t have to wait until it’s empty… And the one [gender-neutral bathroom] between the dance studios and the 200s looks to me like it’s hardly ever used. The one of the 300s that I understand might be preferred, but there are other options as well.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dr. Endelman added that the system cost less than $2,000 dollars for an annual contract and was paid for with the state funding the school receives and not conservatory funds. In summary, the implementation of bathroom kiosks at CSArts aims to enhance safety and efficiency, with positive reports of reduced restroom time. While some concerns exist, the administration is actively addressing issues like privacy and accessibility. As the school community adjusts, there is optimism for an improved and inclusive experience for all students at CSArts.</p>]]></content><author><name>MJ Cho &amp; Abigail Risdon</name></author><category term="updates" /><category term="featured" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When the bathroom kiosks were introduced around a month ago, it came as a surprise to some students.

<p>The Five Nights At Freddy’s Movie dropped on October 27, meaning the long-loved indie horror game franchise finally made its big screen and small screen debut to a variety of mixed reviews. I saw the movie the day before Halloween at a late night viewing in an empty theater, meaning there was no audience energy to enhance the movie.</p>

<p>For some context, I have never seen or heard any of the “lore” from the games before I saw the movie, so I went into it seeing it as a horror movie, not a video game adaptation. As a horror movie, it has some pitfalls and story moments that drag it down from breaking out of the shadow from the games. The main problem with the movie is its rating. PG-13 is way too low for a movie with the premise that FNAF has. So many times the movie created tension and was building up to a scare, but it would always cut away to a shadow of the killing or a blood splatter on a wall. The second pitfall is the constant tonal inconsistency. One minute, the movie is dark and suspenseful. The next, it’s a joke-filled montage. There was rarely a time that I felt like the movie knew what it wanted to be for more than 15 minutes. The last big problem for the movie for me was the twist ending. Without spoilers, the “twist villain” was very obvious from the beginning. There was only one character that fit the hints the movie was giving us, so when they acted like the reveal was out of nowhere, it fell flat on its face.</p>

<p>Onto the good. It did feel like it was made with passion. The production team was fantastic, and from what I’ve heard from my FNAF loving sister, there were a lot of easter eggs. Plus, the various cameos throughout the movie added to the sense of love and care that I felt emanating from the screen. While the payoffs were lackluster, the tension was always there. I never knew what was going to happen, and I was on the edge of my seat. The best thing about the movie was the chemistry of  the main characters. I genuinely enjoyed the little character moments throughout the movie and empathized with their struggles and motivations.</p>

<p>Overall, the best part about  FNAF is the fact it got made in the first place. Seeing a movie about an indie, horror game franchise, about animatronics, actually be made is fascinating. Combined with the success of the Mario Movie, the future of video game movies looks bright. FNAF is a non-scary horror movie with a mediocre twist, but also a movie with so much genuine passion behind it with solid writing. I give the FNAF movie a 6/10.</p>]]></content><author><name>Braedon Younger</name></author><category term="reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a spoiler-free review of “Five Nights at Freddy’s”.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://0.0.0.0:4000/assets/images/posts/fnaf-review.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://0.0.0.0:4000/assets/images/posts/fnaf-review.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Empowering Children Through Music</title><link href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/empowering-through-music/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Empowering Children Through Music" /><published>2023-11-17T06:00:10-06:00</published><updated>2023-11-17T06:00:10-06:00</updated><id>http://0.0.0.0:4000/empowering-through-music</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://0.0.0.0:4000/empowering-through-music/"><![CDATA[<p>Have you heard of the Dragon Kim Music Foundation? It’s a program rooted at CSArts and Orange County School of The Arts named after a student and breaking down barriers hindering aspiring young musicians from pursuing their dreams.</p>

<p>In 2015, the Dragon Kim Music Foundation embarked on a melodious journey, one that would change students’ lives and to provide instruments and top-notch music education without financial constraints.</p>

<p>In January 2016, DKMF launched its music program with just 14 enthusiastic kids. Fast forward to today, it has orchestrated a profound impact. The foundation has planted its roots at Orange County School of the Arts and California School of the Arts, harmonizing diverse communities with the universal language of music. As of now, there are 164 student teachers, 115 instruments, 183 free lessons, and 413 participants. The Foundation hopes to expand even more to make sure that all students, regardless of background or circumstance, has the opportunity to explore the exciting world of music.</p>

<p>Mea Ji, DKMF volunteer of the Recorder program said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Joining the foundation’s music program made me find a place where young hearts and talents flourish.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During each session, teachers expose their students to various musical forms such as band, orchestra, guitar, and choir. Every class brings something great to their minds, with students always leaving the classroom full of joy and excitement!</p>

<p>The foundation has become a platform for high schoolers to not only enhance their musical ability, but also to nurture a community where the passion for music is shared and appreciated.</p>

<p>Grace Botero, DKMF volunteer of the General Music program said,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Teaching the kids is really the highlight of my day. I always enjoy seeing them have fun learning and playing music.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The harmonious notes of their success reverberate through the lives touched by the Dragon Kim Music Foundation, creating a symphony of opportunity, passion, and happiness.</p>

<p>For more information on how you can share your music talent and contribute to the ongoing melody of empowerment for young musicians, contact Dr. Mathew Ward, the Dragon Kim Foundation Music Program Coordinator.</p>]]></content><author><name>Karina Yue</name></author><category term="updates" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you heard of the Dragon Kim Music Foundation?

That’s the message sent via email to CSArts families by Dr. Endelman. It contained an even more concerning message that administrators would have to furlough the first week of conservatory because donations are down. This year, the donations and pledges from families/sponsors totaled a little more than half  the 2.8 million dollars needed to fund conservatory programs each year. He explained that while tax-payer dollars pay for the academic day, it is up to the school to privately fundraise the annual budget for each conservatory. This budget includes money for equipment and supplies, facilities, performance opportunities, guest artist master teachers, field trips, and pays the  salaries for conservatory teachers and directors.</p>

<p>With this news in mind, school administration decided to cut the first week of conservatory instructional time after winter break. While this will allow the school to save $60,000 in expenses, it also means that conservatory staff will lose a week’s worth of salary. This decision will not affect pre-scheduled rehearsals. The Pick your Passion project, which was announced by CSArts’ Foundations Team just a day after the first announcements of cutbacks, will aim to “bridge the gap in conservatory budgets and support essential needs and experiences for our deserving students.” said Dr. Endelman in another statement sent out to CSArts-SGV families.</p>

<p>While nothing has been released about what this means for each conservatory, the hope is to raise enough funds to prevent any further changes to the conservatory schedule for this school year.</p>]]></content><author><name>Evyn Clayton</name></author><category term="misc" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“CSArts-SGV Needs Your Help”.

Your shoes crush candy wrappers scattering the floor, and little kids run by, hands clutching plastic bags full of sweets. Every doorstep is lined with carved pumpkins, skeleton garlands, and light-up ghosts; every lawn is covered with tombstones and zombie hands. People walk around decked out in skulls, masks, and faux bandages, fully immersed in the whirlwind of the holiday.</p>

<p>Pretty great, right? Sure. But after the spooky fun, a question arises: pumpkins, costumes, candy… what happens to all that stuff? In many cases, the answer isn’t as sweet.</p>

<p>Take jack o’ lanterns, for example. Out of the people who buy pumpkins to carve them, over half throw them away afterward. According to Hummingbird International, 18,000 tons of pumpkins – that’s like 360 million portions of pumpkin pie – are dumped in landfills, and they release methane gas when decomposed, a greenhouse gas that’s around 20 times more harmful to the environment than CO2.</p>

<p>But pumpkins aren’t the only thing that end up in landfills. Every year, 35 million Halloween costumes are thrown away. Not only that, but it takes more than half of these costumes 20 to 200 years to decompose. Another problem is that, as mentioned by Commons, many costumes are made from petroleum-based plastics, which use fossil fuels, a non-renewable resource.</p>

<p>Along with the costumes, Halloween candy contributes to a significant portion of plastic packaging waste at 30%.  A Californai  recycling website says candy wrappers are often made of a mix of materials, like aluminum and plastics, and they’re pretty small. This makes them hard to separate and sort, meaning much of it can’t be recycled.</p>

<p>So, how can you help?</p>

<p>One way is to find candy that uses reusable or biodegradable packaging, or even a replacement for candy instead, like cookies or oranges with jack o’ lantern faces. You can also repurpose, recycle, or donate your costumes, as less thrown away means less textile waste. Same idea for pumpkins: instead of chucking them, try composting them, cooking them, or feeding them to pets.</p>

<p>And remember, these aren’t the only actions you can take to make a change. Being eco-conscious starts with little things like this, but staying eco-conscious takes a little more effort. Those were just a few ways you and your community can help out the environment… so that next Halloween isn’t such a scare.</p>]]></content><author><name>Danica Chen</name></author><category term="essays" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Imagine: it’s the night of Halloween, and you’re taking a walk down the street to meet up at your friend’s house for a Halloween party.

For many years, the story of Thanksgiving has been rewritten to conceal its dark history. Some may have grown up with the story of a happy celebration between Indigenous people and Europeans, where both ate dinner together in peace. These sugar-coated stories – among many others – have caused lasting damage.</p>

<p>In reality, according to the Smithsonian Magazine, massacres and disease shaped the holiday into what is known today as Thanksgiving. The Wampanoag tribe, one of the indigenous tribes living in America at the time, was most connected with the story of Thanksgiving. Massasoit, the chief of the Wampanoag tribe, sought an alliance with the settlers of Plymouth. Many of his people had been infected with disease and he hoped for help.</p>

<p>This Thanksgiving “peace” did not last. The Wampanoag tribe and the settlers of Plymouth fought against France and other local indigenous tribes. As more Europeans arrived, the Wampanoag tribe continued to die from the diseases brought over by early settlers. After Massasoit passed away, his son Metacomet, known as King Philip, became chief. Soon the strained relations between the Wampanoag tribe and European settlers finally broke. Metacomet’s men were slaughtered for the murder of John Sassamon, a Ponkapoag interpreter and Christian convert, sparking a bloody and devastating war. Metacomet was beheaded and dismembered.</p>

<p>Due to the dark past of Thanksgiving, many U.S. citizens call for a reexamination of the meaning of the holiday. In 1970, the Aquinnah Wampanoag activist Frank James helped establish a National Day of Mourning, which occurs on November 23. The plaque at Cole’s Hill in Plymouth, Massachusetts states, “It is a day of remembrance and spiritual connection as well as a protest of the racism and oppression which Native Americans continue to experience.”</p>

<p>The true origin of Thanksgiving has been shrouded for generations. Many debate over the date of the first Thanksgiving. Some argue it occurred in 1637 when Governor John Winthrop celebrated the massacre of 900 Pequot indigenous people. Others think it was in 1621.</p>

<p>Now the world knows the truth of Thanksgiving. Communities around the world celebrate what they are thankful for while also remembering Thanksgiving’s past. Knowing the horrors of history has inspired people to enlighten others. We must all learn from past mistakes and work to maintain gratitude and peace.</p>]]></content><author><name>Pippin Langdon</name></author><category term="essays" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Thanksgiving is a time to remember the truth.

Each year it is also a remembrance to the families and communities of Native Americans who share the history of the celebration. The first Thanksgiving lasted three days and was a banquet of unionizing the Wampanoag tribe and the Pilgrims who arrived from the Mayflower seeking a new life and work in America. On November 23, 1621, when there was roasted corn and vegetables, the Pilgrims betrayed the Wampanoag tribe by stealing their food, land and spreading diseases to the Native Americans.</p>

<p>Checking out Indigenous artists’ work during this year’s Native American Heritage Month is an amazing way to show support for the community. Published this year, Leah Myers’ memoir “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinning-Blood-Memoir-Family-Identity/dp/1324036702">Thinning Blood</a>” speaks on how growing up Native American and the trials and tribulations of the possibility of being the last member of her family to qualify in her tribe. Myers writes her poetry in the form of a totem, each pillar is dedicated to an important woman in her life. In this heart wrenching book there are elements of folklore, growing up and finding one’s true identity.</p>

<p>For the people who want to immerse themselves in a fantasy novel this autumn, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shape-Dragons-Breath-First-Nampeshiweisit/dp/0593498283">To Shape A Dragon’s Breath</a>,” by Monique Blackgoose tells the story of a young Indigenous woman in the 19th century who learns to adapt and overcome her school’s racist and colonial environment. “To Shape a Dragons Breath” is just the beginning for Blackgoose’s Nampeshiweisit series where beasts and mythical creatures are met at every page.</p>

<p>Hulu dramedy, <a href="https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/reservation-dogs">Reservation Dogs</a> takes place in Eastern Oklhoma where a teenage group of delinquents go about their day to day lives robbing and saving money to begin a rejuvenated life in their dreamy, romanticized California. This gem of a show targets the soul with its themes of grief and healing with a dash of laughter. It is a perfect binge-watch for this Thanksgiving break with friends and family.</p>]]></content><author><name>Sophia Gutierrez</name></author><category term="reviews" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The American national holiday where most gather to feast on delicious traditional stuffed turkey and creamy mashed potatoes is just around the corner.

Because he heard it was going to be “spook”-tacular! This October, CSArts had a “spooktacular” party of their own by hosting another amazing “Spooky Fest.”</p>

<p>The event consisted of many thrilling events such as trunk or treat, club fundraisers, student performances, and a student-directed haunted house! Located out on the field, parents and students decorated their cars with spooky ribbons, pumpkins, and spider webs, with games for students to have a shot at winning sugary treats. In the Quad, clubs held fundraisers, selling food and drinks like boba, root beer floats, and donuts, as well as trinkets like bracelets and plants. On stage, Popular Music, Dance, and Instrumental Music students wowed the crowd with their performances.</p>

<p>But the spookiest attraction of all was the haunted house located in the cafeteria. Directed by the Junior Co-Class presidents, the house consisted of students acting as bloody clowns, creepy contortionists, frightening carnival characters, and more. With student-done makeup, decorations, and costumes, the event was a huge hit, and had a line out the door the entire time. Students and adults alike were amazed by the effort and fun of the event. One student comments,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The haunted house was fun and I like the effort the actors put into it, from the costumes, to the makeup, and the props. Their acting was funny and entertaining!”</p>

This October, CSArts had a “spooktacular” party of their own by hosting another amazing “Spooky Fest.”]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://0.0.0.0:4000/assets/images/posts/none/7.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://0.0.0.0:4000/assets/images/posts/none/7.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Student Online Safety</title><link href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/online-safety/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Student Online Safety" /><published>2023-11-17T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-11-17T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://0.0.0.0:4000/online-safety</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://0.0.0.0:4000/online-safety/"><![CDATA[<p>It’s safe to say that the majority of high-schoolers, especially CSArts students, are very active online. Many may feel like their phones are extensions of themselves. It’s easy to become immersed in the whole spectacle and find a sense of community, but it’s becoming easier to stumble upon the darker sides of the web, especially given the current state of the world right now. Keeping yourself safe, prioritizing your mental health, and distancing yourself from the vitriol online is more important now than ever.</p>

<p>We at the CSArtisan believe that one should prioritize keeping up to date with current events and educating oneself about global issues, but not at the expense of your mental health and personal comforts. The internet can be used to learn about so much so thoroughly, but it becomes a problem when it affects our collective mental health.</p>

<p>It’s vital to be able to critically analyze and evaluate the sources of information or media on the internet. Information on the internet is everywhere, but so is misinformation. The skill to properly evaluate sources and separate fact from opinion is called media literacy. Here’s how you can start:</p>

<p>First, ask questions about the content you’re viewing. Who created it, and what’s their agenda? What do they want to convince you of? What kinds of bias might they have? What kind of emotional appeals are they using? Where do they get their information?</p>

<p>Second, diversify your sources to gain a broader perspective, and always fact-check information. While having too many sources can be overwhelming, having a variety of sources with different individual biases can be helpful in straining out the important details. It’s also very important to double check for the specific context and date of the information.</p>

<p>Third, reduce your exposure to violent or political content. There are many resources to help filter content that may be violent in nature, or generally stress-inducing. Using content filters and parental controls helps limit the amount of potentially violent content on your social media feed, and also helps you unplug generally and focus more on the real world.</p>

<p>Fourth, installing ad blockers and content filters is a good idea for any internet user, but especially those who want to avoid potentially troubling content. Your attention on the internet is a very valuable thing, and unfortunately people will go to great lengths to harness it by deliberately promoting provocative or unsettling content to bring in attention. Utilizing ad blockers will not only make your experience on the internet a little less annoying, but it also can protect you from triggering media.</p>

<p>Generally, the best way to ensure that you won’t be thrust into any uncomfortable or triggering online media is to be selective in choosing who you connect with online and where you get your information from.</p>

<p>We, at the CSArtisan, recognize that times are changing, and it’s scary, but in the face of it all remember that we each have the autonomy to create a better digital sphere and generally make the world a kinder place.</p>]]></content><author><name>Samson Khachatryan</name></author><category term="misc" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s safe to say that the majority of high-schoolers, especially CSArts students, are very active online.

Without them, our world would cease to exist.  With them, comes concerns, but you can help! Cleaning up after yourself might be the key to reducing the swarms. Recently, bees have been buzzing around and inside trash cans on campus and classrooms, as well as circling around students during lunch, crawling on, and eating their food. Some students are allergic to bees, so this is a source of concern. Epi-pens are available at the Health Office just in case.</p>

<p>Students have shown signs of discomfort toward the bees, likely because no one wants to get stung.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I tried to eat my lunch… outside and a bee also wanted to eat my lunch so I had to move locations,”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>says Katie C. (VA ‘27).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve never been stung or anything, but they’ve been flying around and crawling on food we’re supposed to be eating,”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>says Rochelle W. (CW ‘27).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That’s not cool.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>School administrators say there are solutions to the “bee problem.”  In the Weekly Wrap on November 3rd, 2023, CSArts administration issued a statement on the bees, writing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our Facilities Team completed an inspection and concluded that there are no active hives on campus. With this in mind, please understand that bees are a vital part of the natural ecosystem, and our campus does experience seasonal fluctuations of their activity throughout the year. The maintenance team is working hard to resolve some of the issues and concerns by increasing clean up on campus, landscaping, and frequently deep cleaning our trash cans, as bees are attracted to these areas.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for what students can do to help with the bee problems, admin says,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Students can do their part by cleaning up after themselves and ensuring that their trash goes into the appropriate receptacles.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other possible ways to avoid the bees include staying away from the trash cans or using smells that bees don’t like like cloves and peppermint. With work from both the maintenance crew and CSArts students, the bee issues should lesson as we head into colder temperatures and wet weather during the Winter.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ren Carr &amp; Noelle Lee</name></author><category term="updates" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The buzz of bees around campus is bittersweet.
