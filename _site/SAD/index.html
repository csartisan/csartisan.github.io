"},{id:1,url:"https://csartisan.org/about.html",title:"About",body:"We, the CSArts Newspaper, are an official student-produced publication. As an entity, we aim to serve as a designated open, public forum for freedom of expression for students to freely disseminate information and express their ideas. Under the rights delegated by the First Amendment and California Education Code 48907, we operate without prior review and produces content that reflects the views of the student body (within legal and ethical bounds). Our student editorial board and student staff members assume complete legal liability for the content of the publication. On our part, this includes openly admitting to and promptly correcting mistakes. By holding ourselves accountable for our work, we also are prepared to justify the actions we take and the content we publish. In the case of a student injury or death, coverage will generally take the form of hard news in which we will include the student\u2019s name unless the a parent or student does not want the name to be released. However, we will respect the parents\u2019 wishes for the way in which the student will be covered. Because we aim to deliver accurate information in our content, we will verify all facts surrounding articles both in print and online. Interviewed quotes will have the support of handwritten or voice-recorded transcripts. In the case that we mistake a fact, misquote someone, or publish photos of the wrong person or event in an online article, we will promptly update it with the correct information and make a note when the revision was made. For our print articles, revisions will be made when we publish the content online \u2014 unless the article is libelous, offensive, or editorializes a hard news topic, in which we will print a retraction the following issue. Furthermore, because we have the right to no prior review, it is all the more important to apply ethical prudence so that content is produced responsibly, keeping in mind the people\u2019s best interests. The First Amendment\u2019s protections intend to serve not the press, but the people. As journalists, we exercise these rights to thoroughly investigate and report all issues in an unbiased, objective manner. This unbiased method of reporting ensures that we fairly address all sides of an issue to uphold the truth for our readers. We will try to minimize harm by understanding the implications of our work and showing sensitivity to all sides of a story. Electronic media produced by this online newspaper is entitled to the same protections \u2013 and subjected to the same freedoms and responsibilities \u2013 as media produced for print publication. As such, they are not subject to prior review. These include, but are not limited to, posts, videos and tweets. Here, we try to reflect the voice of the student body as best as we can. Therefore, we welcome all types of feedback and student submissions. We meet bi-weekly on Thursdays. Should you be interested in being a part of the school paper, feel free to stop by during a meeting, sending us an email at sophia. brunet@sgv. csarts. net. These contributions can come in form of student-produced articles and letters, photographs, editorial cartoons and guest opinion writers. We will publish these student submissions online if we determine that the content is truthful and relevant to the student body. We strongly urge student participation in order to encompass the entire scope of the CSArts community.

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at csartsnewspaper@gmail. com.     CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES:   Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (\u201cDNT\u201d) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

What factors led to the decision to invest in the detectors?:  Student, parent, and teacher feedback over the past couple of years. And while we were doing focus groups and research for our most recent WASC accreditation. So this work started before I got here a couple of years ago. And that work led our team to believe one of the best ways to address what I heard was a pervasive amount of smoking. \u201d What process do students go through when these detectors are used for investigation?:  Our practice and it\u2019s an evolving practice\u2026 But our practice right now is: if the vape detectors go off at a certain level, that indicates that there might be some vaping going on. Our staff is immediately informed, and security brings that student to the office for a quick search. We try to do them as quickly as possible. And then students get to go back to class. However, we live in an imperfect world, and I\u2019m an imperfect person who also has scheduled meetings. So if there\u2019s a meeting, if I\u2019m in a meeting, and someone gets brought in, sadly, we will ask that person to wait because it\u2019s not realistic to send that person back if they\u2019re suspected of having done this thing. \u201d If a vape device is found, how is the situation typically handled?:  There\u2019s an ED code against students having tobacco products, marijuana products, drug paraphernalia, and those types of things on campus. They\u2019re held accountable, according to the ED Code. Typically, that\u2019s suspension. I can\u2019t think of when it hasn\u2019t been a suspension in my tenure\u2026 We believe in restorative practices here. So a student who is suspended does earn demerits, but has an opportunity to make those demerits go away through the use of a Restorative Action Plan, which is 100%, the student\u2019s responsibility to opt in and participate in. \u201d What are some examples of some things that might be in the Restorative Action Plan?:  People have written songs, content therapy, done things around the house for their parents, and volunteered to work extra time at the front desk. One person did beach cleanup. Others have done PowerPoint presentations. One person did an analysis on parking practices. So it would be impactful for them as it relates to why a student received that type of suspension. \u201d What data has been gathered before and after implementing the vape sensors?:  Since full implementation in early January, from that week to the next week, the number of detections went down by 50%. By the next week, it went down 50%. And the next week, it probably went down 70%. So either we\u2019ve gotten better at gaming the system, or we\u2019re choosing to make better choices, I\u2019m hoping we\u2019re choosing to make better choices. But I\u2019m realistic, and understand that people have been smoking in bathrooms and high schools since before I was born\u2026 It\u2019s my hope that it\u2019s gotten a little better. At the end of the year, I\u2019ll probably do like some many focus groups and try to talk to some students and see what they\u2019ve seen from January to June, and see where we\u2019re at. \u201d What is the most commonly confiscated item?:  Lighters and nicotine vapes. A lighter alone is a suspension; it\u2019s one of those things in the ED code listed under like cigarette products. \u201d How does the vape system discern between substances?:  We get a report from the base detector system. It has different types of particles where it will say, this might be more likely this. And that differentiates between colognes, Nicotine, and marijuana. But the system is also there to detect noise and keep students safe\u2026So in case there\u2019s a bunch of people screaming, which is typical high school behavior, there\u2019s noise peaks. \u201d Why have some students have had their phones taken?:  Because it\u2019s an investigation about what happened within the bathroom at that time. We found that sometimes these investigation leads to other people who aren\u2019t in the hallway at that time\u2026When students have their phones, misinformation gets posted on the internet. People get told to go hide your drugs, and it negatively impacts our ability to get some real information. It\u2019s not a confiscation. We hold it. We don\u2019t go into it. We don\u2019t do anything. The minute that we\u2019re done with that investigation, bone comes back. \u201d What are the resources or support available for students dealing with substance-related challenges on campus?:  All of our counselors have access to information and direct support for students who are struggling with drug use\u2026 there\u2019s also a Wellness Center. We have a thing called Care Solace, which is a free referral service for anyone in our organization, not just students, but teachers and any of our people that need some direct support\u201d "},{id:21,url:"https://csartisan.org/blame-it-on-the-rain/",title:"Blame It on the Rain",body:"2024/02/23 - Picture this: CSArts students in rain jackets crowd the pathways to classes, umbrellas crashing together, it\u2019s rainy season in Southern California. The problem is some parts of Southern California received their annual rainfall in just two days, with parts of the San Gabriel Valley getting 10 inches for the first storm, and another 3 inches last week. Students who love the rain are all happy and delighted, but other students are used to the California sun, and hate the wet weather on our \u201coutdoor campus. \u201d The tarps around campus are meant to provide shade to students and can\u2019t handle rain at this intensity, which leads to students getting splashed and soggy. Throughout the rainy season, the campus has witnessed flooding in many different parts of the school due to the heavier than normal rain. Plus, leaves, wood chips, and other objects clogging up the drains. One of the major challenges is outdoor nutrition and lunch lines. CSArts administrators have addressed these issues, discussing moving the lines to a covered area. Also, there are shade covers near these lines that are not being used due to the fact that the shade covers cannot handle the amount of rain with these record breaking storms. The buildings in the 400s have leaks in the roofs. With all the umbrellas, it causes traffic jams in the narrow path when students are heading to classes. CSArts admin are working on solutions for problems on campus, but the problem extends outside of campus, with Duarte\u2019s infrastructure being challenged by mudslides from the foothills. With the way the sewage and water works in Duarte, everything comes from the high mountains and hills to the low streets, creating more collection and more standing water. CSArts does their best to address possible problems before it rains.  The leakage in the gym was affected by Duarte Unified putting new air exchangers on the roof and those connections aren\u2019t fully sealed as well as they could be. So there were leaks in the gym,\u201d assistant principal Mr. Metoyer said. He is also aware of the water puddling up in the 100s, 200s, and the Quad. The problem is that cash, unlike rain, doesn\u2019t fall from the sky.  We have a limited capital budget and that\u2019s the budget that we use every summer to fix things,\u201d Metoyer said.  It will be hard to spend a decent amount of that budget when it rains, which is only a few days a year. \u201d Admin is being focusing on what they can control and fix, with these goals:  Replacing the tarps with one individual durable tarp that slightly bends at both ends so there are no open spaces Mats that soak up water efficiently to be put near the front doors of each classroom 2 buckets for each classroom to put umbrellasYou can always reach out to admin with any concerns or ideas on how to better deal with the rainy weather. "},{id:22,url:"https://csartisan.org/wrestling/",title:"Wrestling with the Words",body:"2024/02/23 - This semester, creative writing teacher Daniel Strasberger introduced a new and unique course to the conservatory\u2019s class repertoire: Storytelling in Pro Wrestling. \xa0 A long time fan of the sport, Mr. Strasberger jumped on the opportunity to teach this class when it first arose, but he wasn\u2019t so sure it would get a good response from the students. \xa0  It is very niche; it is very weird. So I was definitely worried if there wouldn\u2019t be as much engagement. \u201d But with professional wrestling\u2019s rich storytelling, combined with Mr. Strasberger\u2019s passion, the class was bound to attract some. With a class size of 20 students, it\u2019s safe to say it did. Pro wrestling, while originating from legitimately competition-based sport, has long since been scripted\u2013 focusing more on showy moves, characters, and plotlines that garner massive audience reactions. According to Mr. Strasberger, this writing is \u201cthe purest form of storytelling. \u201d He makes the joke often, arguing that \u201cit\u2019s good and bad. That\u2019s the pureness of it. \u201d Students\u2019 reasons for taking the class varied widely. When Santiago Awori signed up for it, they were already working on a wrestler character, and joined so that they could learn \u201chow to write her in her own story. \u201d Now that they\u2019re in the class, they\u2019re finding the variety of matches and promos shown in the class valuable. On the other hand, Zoe Lopez is excited to start writing characters and stories, having grown up around wrestling. The class is proving to be promising, and students are already finding value and fun in it. Mr. Strasberger claims there are more exciting things to come, too, with a field trip to meet with real professional wrestlers in the works. "},{id:23,url:"https://csartisan.org/course-selection/",title:"Course Selection",body:"2024/02/23 - Honors, AP, and Citrus College classes are available at CSArts. If you haven\u2019t taken advantage of these courses because you are unsure of the workload, we talked with students about the courses. Honors:: Honors classes are to help students prepare for college-level work. There are many options on campus, including: Honors Biology, Honors Chemistry, Honors English, and other language classes. \u201cHonors Chem is a lot of work and challenging at times, especially if Chemistry is not a subject you are interested in. But once you understand the topic it gets easier. \u201d If you take an honors course, you can expect more rigorous assignments and an increase in homework compared to CP classes. Advanced Placement Courses (AP):: AP courses offer even more advantages but students should expect an 5 additional hours of homework per week. Although AP courses add on extra work, students have the option of taking the AP exam at the end of the year to get college credit, plus they look very good on transcripts! Some examples of AP classes that students have said have nightly homework: AP U. S. History, AP World History, AP Physics, AP Statistics. Citrus College Courses:: Students can start their college career at CSArts! While performing well on the AP test can get you possible college credit, Citrus College classes are college classes, with college credit. The classes are challenging, but they also help students shave off time until graduation and save money.  The Citrus College courses really helped me understand what it\u2019s like to be in a college class and equip me with experience for after I graduate,\u201d said MJ Cho (CW\u201924) Additionally, if you take an honors or AP class, your GPA goes automatically up one point. This means if you earn a C, the C will show up on the transcript, but that 2. 0 GPA, changes to a 3. 0! Everything you need to know about all the courses is in the CSArts curriculum handbook. Hopefully, this gives you an idea of what you may be interested in to select your courses for the next year!

While it\u2019s true that countless things are more entertaining than watching, for example, several earthworms fleeing the rain, these animals have actually helped me to relax, and have become an anxiety coping method. The activity of observing insects or small creatures is calming because it is repetitive and slow, similarly to yoga. Over time, it can become a trance where nothing exists except for the animal. Naturally, if the mind is engrossed in watching the animal, it cannot worry, and will be at rest. When the trance ends, and if the mind is given time to rejuvenate with sleep, food, and water, it will be able to function well. Even if you live in the city and aren\u2019t familiar with the outdoors, it\u2019s fairly easy to find creatures on campus. Mr. Crumley, who teaches Biology and Honors Biology says our campus\u2019 location brings a diversity of wildlife.  Since it is closer to the foothills, there\u2019s definitely a lot more biodiversity. \u201d Crumley says that several species live nearby include: cougars, bobcats, finches, bears, and coyotes. And you can\u2019t leave out the insect population.  You can pretty much find anything in the San Gabriel Valley area, your typical insects like praying mantises. The monarch butterflies come here during the season, so you might see some monarchs flying by here and there. \u201d He adds,  If you go out to the field, actually, during the springtime, you\u2019ll see a bunch of dragonflies out there. \u201d Large animals, as well as small ones, visit CSArts occasionally.  I\u2019ve heard we\u2019ve had possums,\u201d Mr. Crumley says.  A skunk or two found their home in the dance studios in the past. \u201d Next time you start to walk by a small animal, whether it\u2019s a butterfly or a frog, stay a minute. There are lessons in how each animal lives\u2013in the loyalty of the ants to their queen, in the way squirrels steal bird seed, and in the way worms cross sidewalks, unable to realize they\u2019re almost getting stepped on. They\u2019re just waiting to be found.

So, the big question is, will there be a new Film/TV conservatory? Not exactly. Dr. Cook, Assistant Principal at CSARTs-SGV says that Film, Television, and Media Technology won\u2019t have its own conservatory.  We were thinking of doing a Film, Television and Media Technologies Conservatory but the more we started talking to the [other conservatory] directors, so many of the conservatories wanted to be a part of it. \u201d With this in mind, the school decided to make a Film, Television and Media technologies program, meaning there will be multiple classes spread through already existing conservatories. This way, students in Production &amp; Design, Creative Writing, Acting, etc. will be able to take Film, Television and Media Art classes related to their own conservatories.  We thought that it would actually be able to serve more students if we offered it as a program. \u201d Dr. Cook said. Another question that came to many students\u2019 minds was how the school will be funding the new program. Especially considering the cut on this year\u2019s conservatory schedule due to under-funding issues. Dr. Cook explained that the school received an SWP (Strong Workforce Program) Grant from the state of California, which is designed to offer training to students who are looking to enter the workforce after high school. He added that this is the same grant that is being used to boost the school\u2019s E-Sports and Computer Science programs. The upcoming program represents an initiative aimed at providing students with a diverse skill set to meet the needs of today\u2019s job market. Across various disciplines, the curriculum will offer a range of classes designed to equip students with practical skills in film, television, and media technologies. These classes will cover topics such as camera production, acting for the camera, digital video content creation, film making, script writing, film scoring, etc. Scheduled to begin in the fall of 2025, the program will provide students with an opportunity to explore their interests and develop their abilities within a supportive educational environment. Although students will have to wait to take any Film, Television, and Media technology classes through our school until Fall 2025, UCLA\u2019s Film and Television Summer Institute allows students to take classes in Digital Filmmaking, Writing for TV, Cinematography, Traditional Animation, and Media Parks. The program also allows students to experience the UCLA campus while earning college credit and networking with other emerging artist from around the globe. Students who are interested in the UCLA summer institute can find more information on Student Square or by speaking directly with their school counselor.

Over 70 donors rolled up their sleeves and donated 73 pints of blood. This amount could save as many as 220 lives!

I strive to create a positive environment so students and community members continue to help in any way possible,\u201d sophomore Makenna Bear said. CSArts-SGV also collaborated with Duarte High School\u2019s Interact Club to host a blood drive with City of Hope in order to further their impact. Approximately 65 donors made up of staff and students donated in this separate event and students understand by donating, they can make a difference and save lives.

Rumors of termites, deterioration, and admin losing the 400\u2019s have spread around the school. But what\u2019s true and what\u2019s false? Dr. Endelman, Principal at CSArts, says he had no knowledge of termites or deterioration in the 400\u2019s when asked about the problems.  There\u2019s certain things that get sent to me, and then there\u2019s a lot that just never get sent to me,\u201d he said. He said teachers\u2019 complaints sometimes bypass him and are sent to a team responsible for repairs, so not all information goes straight to him. Regarding the future of the 400s and whether or not we would be losing them to Duarte, Dr. Endelman says.  It\u2019s partially true,\u201d referring to Duarte wanting the 400s back.  They [the portables] have served as a temporary hub, and that was organized by Duarte. We entered a lease agreement with Duarte but we pay the leasing company, not Duarte. \u201d He was able to give the cost to lease the portables which was over $1 million annually.  That lease is getting ready to expire,\u201d Dr. Endelman says.  So the big question for all of us is what are we going to do about it?\u201d After the completion of Duarte\u2019s new sports complex, they are interested in getting the space back for a parking lot. But admin also has big plans for the land that the 400s sit on.  The long term solution is to get rid of the 400s and close off that backside of the school, letting the school end at the studio portables/PAC and let Duarte High have their parking lot back,\u201d Endelman explained.  My dream is to have permanent buildings. \u201d Dr. Endelman says the most probable location would be Northview park or replacing some of the portable dance studios with permanent buildings.  We\u2019re already having high-level conversations with the school district and the city about what those plans could look like\u2026 It\u2019ll take time and money to get these things accomplished, but I am very excited for the future growth of the school. \u201d Dr. Endelman said there currently is no definitive timeline for the plans.

Tips for neurodivergents at holiday gatherings: Prior to the event:  Practice small talk with a friend and rehearse answers to common questions Ask for alternative/safe food optionsAt the event/Day of the event:  Eat before the gathering/bring snacks if you aren\u2019t 100% sure that there will be food you can eat there Bring or wear headphones or earplugs Wear comfortable clothes and bring something familiar/comforting Have someone you can trust who you can communicate your needs to if necessary (like a parent or a friend) Bring a small fidget toy you can keep in your pocket or in your handTips to accommodate neurodivergents at holiday gatherings::  Set aside a quiet room for guests who may not be able to handle the crowds for the full time Try to keep your volume to a minimum; loud arguments and games of tag can go outside of the main gathering area Ask before touching someone\u2014and respect their answer Take note of their body language\u2014are their shoulders hunched?

Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, and who could forget the Winter Solstice! At CSArts, students celebrate different holidays from around the world. At CSArts, we have clubs that celebrate different holidays and cultures. For Hannakuah, a Jewish holiday, Jews Clues embraces the Jewish holidays and shares that with the campus of CSArts. Hannakuah begins on Kislev 25, usually in December, according to the Gregorian calendar, and is celebrated for eight days. The Hanukkiah, or Menorah, has nine candles. It is to celebrate the miracle that one day\u2019s worth of oil lasted for eight days. Another tradition of Hannakuah is the Dreidel. A dreidel is a spinning top with four sides: Nun, Gimel, Hey or Chai, and Shin. CSArts also supports African American students with Black Student Union (BSU). Kwanzaa is celebrated on December 26 through January 1. Kwanzaa was first created by Dr. Maulana Karenga, a professor of Africana Studies. It was first celebrated in 1966. In Swahili, Kwanzaa means \u201cfirst fruits,\u201d or \u201cfirst fruits of the harvest,\u201d inspired by various African harvests or first fruits festivals. The holiday incorporates elements from celebrations across the African continent. Kwanzaa celebrations also incorporate candles in a tradition of lighting what is called a Kinara.

In some European folklore, Krampus is the opposite of the pure-hearted Santa Claus. With devil horns and goat hooves, Krampus is famous for kidnapping bad children and beating them for being naughty little brats. But what would it take for, I dunno, YOU to be taken by Krampus? Let\u2019s look at what makes a kid \u201cnaughty\u201d in Krampus\u2019s eyes.    Disobedience: The biggest factor for a kidnapping. If you\u2019ve found yourself saying no to your parents when they ask for your help or talking over your teacher in class, you can pretty much tell your life goodbye.     Lying: If you\u2019ve stopped telling the truth and started spreading rumors, sorry, but you\u2019re dead. I don\u2019t make the rules.     Stealing: From grand theft auto to picking up a dollar bill that fell out of someone\u2019s pocket, Krampus will know. If you\u2019re caught stealing, then you\u2019re getting stolen.     Bullying: You don\u2019t even have to be bullying something physically! If you tease your friends a little too hard or even send them a mean-spirited TikTok, Krampus will ban you from this plain of existence.     Lack of Respect: Krampus has a history of stealing children who are mean to their elders, so be nice to your senior friends this holiday season unless you want a one-way ticket into Krampus\u2019 sack.

With this in mind, Metro has been working hard to help ensure the safety of all students, enhancing their own safety programs and policies among their Los Angeles stations. In order to stay safe, The CSArtisan spoke with Metro officials and they suggest always traveling in pairs or groups.  There is always safety in numbers,\u201d Jackie Gonzalez from Metro said. It\u2019s recommended that students stick together while walking to and from the Duarte station each day. In addition, Gonzalez urges students to always be aware of their surroundings.  This means remove headphones so you can hear what is going on around you, put your phone away to eliminate distractions, and be observant of emergency intercoms at the station and on the train in case of any issues arising. \u201d Gonzalez said, If you do see any suspicious or concerning activity on the system, don\u2019t be afraid to report it on the LA Metro Transit Watch app, where you can report via text, phone call, or message through the app.  Safety is number 1 to Metro,\u201d adds Gonzalez.

We aim to recognize and validate the hardships of many during this holiday season, and provide some comfort and guidance to all those who aren\u2019t feeling the most merry and bright. The holidays can be especially stressful for LGBTQ+ students and family members who feel pressured to either conceal or hide their identities around their loved ones. Family gatherings can be a major source of anxiety and discomfort, especially regarding gendered gifts and personal conversations with other family members. The pressure to conform to family expectations or hide one\u2019s true self can be overwhelming, and the sheer stress of holiday preparations, such as gift buying and event planning, can add to the emotional burden. In light of these challenges, The Trevor Project\xa0says it\u2019s vital to practice self-care and utilize the resources available. Simple strategies like setting boundaries, making time for relaxation and hobbies can be incredibly beneficial and can take some of the stress out of those uncomfy dinner parties or gift exchanges. It\u2019s also important to stay connected with supportive friends or communities who understand and affirm your identity and feelings\u2013 thankfully, in the age of the internet, it\u2019s easy to maintain regular communication with those who help you feel seen and appreciated for who you are. Make sure to reach out for help and comfort if/when you\u2019re stressed! Additionally, practicing mindfulness when needed are also key steps in maintaining your mental well being\u2013 it might take some effort, but conscious patience and the use of grounding techniques can go a long way, in stressful situations and in general. \xa0 For those questioning their spirituality, the holidays can intensify feelings of doubt or isolation. It\u2019s crucial to remember that questioning is a natural part of personal growth, and that there is no shame in having questions. \u201cHolidays are supposed to be about peace, hope, and love. Conversations about differences in faith or politics can wreak havoc at the dinner table. Your faith journey is personal, so boundaries by having a plan or a phrase when challenging topics are brought up, can be incredibly effective. This will keep the\xa0 peace between relatives and yourself,\u201d said Mr. Blair, who is also a minister and chaplain. Seeking support from experienced members of your community can provide comfort and guidance during this season.

With so much talent and skill, some people find it difficult to focus on their own strengths and may begin to feel that they haven\u2019t really earned the things they\u2019ve accomplished. Well, you may have heard of the phenomenon of impostor syndrome. In short, having impostor syndrome is characterized by doubts or failing to believe that you earned something or achieved something on your own account such as being skilled in a certain subject or being exceptionally smart. It\u2019s very clear how this could apply to the mindset of some artists. It\u2019s not uncommon to know someone who may be experiencing this or even experiencing impostor syndrome yourself! It is believed that this feeling stems from how we, as humans, perceive ourselves vs. others. It is natural to be aware of one\u2019s own perceived flaws or shortcomings, but that\u2019s ultimately what makes us human. Signs of impostor syndrome can be found in a variety of people from all sorts of backgrounds. Seeing the sometimes idealized appearance of others can cause one to doubt their own abilities as they focus on the performances of these other people, not seeing the effort they may have put into something. Being around so many amazing artists could bring forth these feelings.  I always felt like my art wasn\u2019t good enough and that I could never be as good as the people around me,\u201d said Sara Tran (VA \u201826). Even while being incredibly skilled, some still feel that they aren\u2019t enough. This is totally okay! Despite being so prevalent, it can be difficult to talk about impostor syndrome given how personal it is. But, it is believed that talking about it or hearing that others feel similar can help a lot. It\u2019s important to be supportive of others that may be struggling with these thoughts or to find someone to talk to if you feel this way too. It\u2019s normal to doubt yourself but it\u2019s important to remember what you have accomplished!

Following a healthy sleep schedule also improves your mood and lowers the risk for serious health problems (like heart disease).     Nutritionists say to eat healthy. Consistently eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and protein in a balanced and colorful diet. \u201cFor those having long days for rehearsals and conservatory classes, please carry extra healthy snacks to keep your bodies and brains fueled throughout the day,\u201d advises Susan Macknin, registered nurse for the school. Vitamins C and D boost your immune system and help fight colds.     Stay hydrated. Be sure to drink plenty of water every day! \u201cRemember to bring your water bottle and refill it during the day on campus,\u201d says the school nurse.     Clean your hands. Sometimes the simplest tips are the most effective \u2013 wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds to remove germs. Also, avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.     Exercise regularly. High schoolers should get at least one hour of moderate exercise each day. This includes walking, running, participating in sports, or even just attending your P. E. class (or conservatory, if you\u2019re a dancer).     Keep warm. The immune system isn\u2019t as effective when cold air enters the nose and upper airways. Though California winters are far from extreme, wear layers during the chilly months.     Mental health is vital! According to the National Institutes of Health, too much stress can cause a weakened (or compromised) immune response. Long-term stress can impede physical and mental health and lead to anxiety, depression, and other health issues. \u201cPractice stress-reducing techniques such as slow, deep breathing, meditation, or exercise,\u201d says the school nurse. She advises students to avoid cramming, procrastinating, and overwhelming themselves with work. Visit the Wellness Center in room 111 for support of your mental well-being.  Follow these tips to help protect yourself from colds and common illnesses. And remember: if you do get sick, stay at home! \u201cIf symptoms are lingering, please wear a mask when you return to school,\u201d says Susan Macknin. It\u2019s easy \u201cto get sick from being in close proximity to others spreading germs. \u201d Stay healthy, CSArts!

With plans for these sign-out stations not previously discussed with students, there was a notable amount of feedback,  I get why they\u2019re doing it, but it sucks,\u201d Samson Khachatryan (CW\u201825) said. The CSArtisan interviewed Mr. Metoyer, the assistant principal, to gather further information, answering the questions the student body continues to ask.  Before I started [at CSArts], Dr. Endelman had already taken some preliminary meetings and read some literature about the benefits of a digital Hall Pass system. When I began after July 1st\u2026 I followed up with a contact to the kid account people, who we use now, to initiate what he asked for,\u201d Mr. Metoyer said.  We\u2019re keeping students safe and responsible for knowing where you guys are at all times. If there is an evacuation situation and someone is in the restroom, this gives us real-time information about where everyone is. If, God forbid, something bad ever happened, we\u2019re able to go do a better job of trying to protect. \u201d He adds the other reported benefits of the bathroom kiosks, saying,  We have received emails from multiple staff members that said students are spending less time on their restroom trips and there are fewer restroom trips. It gives students a greater opportunity to learn. \u201d However, the school community has been raising concerns about students\u2019 birthnames being displayed when creating a new hall pass. Individuals who aren\u2019t comfortable with classmates knowing their previous names are wondering if there is an incoming solution.  We\u2019re working on it,\u201d Metoyer said,  There\u2019s a few barriers. The system is integrated with our school-wide information system which means that\u2026if it\u2019s not on Aeries, I don\u2019t know what someone else\u2019s adopted name is. So we\u2019re trying to figure out what names people are trying to use\u2026The trick comes for those students who have not been that transparent with their parents and are using a different name. We\u2019re going to try to sample a couple of those nicknames that are already approved to see if they could work and then have a full integration with other names. \u201d Another issue that has been brought up amongst CSArts students is the accessibility of gender-neutral bathrooms under the kiosk system due to the restricted amount of gender-neutral bathrooms available.  We\u2019re still in our honeymoon phase, but we\u2019re still learning, right? So what we\u2019re doing is, we\u2019re allowing the system to allow two people to go at one time, which means one person is in, and maybe one person is waiting for a few minutes, and then they can go in\u2026 So it\u2019s a little bit better as far as the transition, you don\u2019t have to wait until it\u2019s empty\u2026 And the one [gender-neutral bathroom] between the dance studios and the 200s looks to me like it\u2019s hardly ever used. The one of the 300s that I understand might be preferred, but there are other options as well. \u201d Dr. Endelman added that the system cost less than $2,000 dollars for an annual contract and was paid for with the state funding the school receives and not conservatory funds. In summary, the implementation of bathroom kiosks at CSArts aims to enhance safety and efficiency, with positive reports of reduced restroom time. While some concerns exist, the administration is actively addressing issues like privacy and accessibility. As the school community adjusts, there is optimism for an improved and inclusive experience for all students at CSArts. "},{id:43,url:"https://csartisan.org/fnaf-review/",title:"Five Nights of Fun, or Five Nights of Failure",body:"2023/11/17 - This is a spoiler-free review of \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s\u201d. The Five Nights At Freddy\u2019s Movie dropped on October 27, meaning the long-loved indie horror game franchise finally made its big screen and small screen debut to a variety of mixed reviews. I saw the movie the day before Halloween at a late night viewing in an empty theater, meaning there was no audience energy to enhance the movie. For some context, I have never seen or heard any of the \u201clore\u201d from the games before I saw the movie, so I went into it seeing it as a horror movie, not a video game adaptation. As a horror movie, it has some pitfalls and story moments that drag it down from breaking out of the shadow from the games. The main problem with the movie is its rating. PG-13 is way too low for a movie with the premise that FNAF has. So many times the movie created tension and was building up to a scare, but it would always cut away to a shadow of the killing or a blood splatter on a wall. The second pitfall is the constant tonal inconsistency. One minute, the movie is dark and suspenseful. The next, it\u2019s a joke-filled montage. There was rarely a time that I felt like the movie knew what it wanted to be for more than 15 minutes. The last big problem for the movie for me was the twist ending. Without spoilers, the \u201ctwist villain\u201d was very obvious from the beginning. There was only one character that fit the hints the movie was giving us, so when they acted like the reveal was out of nowhere, it fell flat on its face. Onto the good. It did feel like it was made with passion. The production team was fantastic, and from what I\u2019ve heard from my FNAF loving sister, there were a lot of easter eggs. Plus, the various cameos throughout the movie added to the sense of love and care that I felt emanating from the screen. While the payoffs were lackluster, the tension was always there. I never knew what was going to happen, and I was on the edge of my seat. The best thing about the movie was the chemistry of the main characters. I genuinely enjoyed the little character moments throughout the movie and empathized with their struggles and motivations. Overall, the best part about FNAF is the fact it got made in the first place. Seeing a movie about an indie, horror game franchise, about animatronics, actually be made is fascinating. Combined with the success of the Mario Movie, the future of video game movies looks bright. FNAF is a non-scary horror movie with a mediocre twist, but also a movie with so much genuine passion behind it with solid writing. I give the FNAF movie a 6/10.

It\u2019s a program rooted at CSArts and Orange County School of The Arts named after a student and breaking down barriers hindering aspiring young musicians from pursuing their dreams. In 2015, the Dragon Kim Music Foundation embarked on a melodious journey, one that would change students\u2019 lives and to provide instruments and top-notch music education without financial constraints. In January 2016, DKMF launched its music program with just 14 enthusiastic kids. Fast forward to today, it has orchestrated a profound impact. The foundation has planted its roots at Orange County School of the Arts and California School of the Arts, harmonizing diverse communities with the universal language of music. As of now, there are 164 student teachers, 115 instruments, 183 free lessons, and 413 participants. The Foundation hopes to expand even more to make sure that all students, regardless of background or circumstance, has the opportunity to explore the exciting world of music. Mea Ji, DKMF volunteer of the Recorder program said,  Joining the foundation\u2019s music program made me find a place where young hearts and talents flourish. \u201d During each session, teachers expose their students to various musical forms such as band, orchestra, guitar, and choir. Every class brings something great to their minds, with students always leaving the classroom full of joy and excitement! The foundation has become a platform for high schoolers to not only enhance their musical ability, but also to nurture a community where the passion for music is shared and appreciated. Grace Botero, DKMF volunteer of the General Music program said,  Teaching the kids is really the highlight of my day. I always enjoy seeing them have fun learning and playing music. The harmonious notes of their success reverberate through the lives touched by the Dragon Kim Music Foundation, creating a symphony of opportunity, passion, and happiness. For more information on how you can share your music talent and contribute to the ongoing melody of empowerment for young musicians, contact Dr. Mathew Ward, the Dragon Kim Foundation Music Program Coordinator.

That\u2019s the message sent via email to CSArts families by Dr. Endelman. It contained an even more concerning message that administrators would have to furlough the first week of conservatory because donations are down. This year, the donations and pledges from families/sponsors totaled a little more than half the 2. 8 million dollars needed to fund conservatory programs each year. He explained that while tax-payer dollars pay for the academic day, it is up to the school to privately fundraise the annual budget for each conservatory. This budget includes money for equipment and supplies, facilities, performance opportunities, guest artist master teachers, field trips, and pays the salaries for conservatory teachers and directors. With this news in mind, school administration decided to cut the first week of conservatory instructional time after winter break. While this will allow the school to save $60,000 in expenses, it also means that conservatory staff will lose a week\u2019s worth of salary. This decision will not affect pre-scheduled rehearsals. The Pick your Passion project, which was announced by CSArts\u2019 Foundations Team just a day after the first announcements of cutbacks, will aim to \u201cbridge the gap in conservatory budgets and support essential needs and experiences for our deserving students. \u201d said Dr. Endelman in another statement sent out to CSArts-SGV families. While nothing has been released about what this means for each conservatory, the hope is to raise enough funds to prevent any further changes to the conservatory schedule for this school year. "},{id:46,url:"https://csartisan.org/truth-of-thanksgiving/",title:"The Truth of Thanksgiving",body:"2023/11/17 - Thanksgiving is a time to remember the truth. For many years, the story of Thanksgiving has been rewritten to conceal its dark history. Some may have grown up with the story of a happy celebration between Indigenous people and Europeans, where both ate dinner together in peace. These sugar-coated stories \u2013 among many others \u2013 have caused lasting damage. In reality, according to the Smithsonian Magazine, massacres and disease shaped the holiday into what is known today as Thanksgiving. The Wampanoag tribe, one of the indigenous tribes living in America at the time, was most connected with the story of Thanksgiving. Massasoit, the chief of the Wampanoag tribe, sought an alliance with the settlers of Plymouth. Many of his people had been infected with disease and he hoped for help. This Thanksgiving \u201cpeace\u201d did not last. The Wampanoag tribe and the settlers of Plymouth fought against France and other local indigenous tribes. As more Europeans arrived, the Wampanoag tribe continued to die from the diseases brought over by early settlers. After Massasoit passed away, his son Metacomet, known as King Philip, became chief. Soon the strained relations between the Wampanoag tribe and European settlers finally broke. Metacomet\u2019s men were slaughtered for the murder of John Sassamon, a Ponkapoag interpreter and Christian convert, sparking a bloody and devastating war. Metacomet was beheaded and dismembered. Due to the dark past of Thanksgiving, many U. S. citizens call for a reexamination of the meaning of the holiday. In 1970, the Aquinnah Wampanoag activist Frank James helped establish a National Day of Mourning, which occurs on November 23. The plaque at Cole\u2019s Hill in Plymouth, Massachusetts states, \u201cIt is a day of remembrance and spiritual connection as well as a protest of the racism and oppression which Native Americans continue to experience. \u201d The true origin of Thanksgiving has been shrouded for generations. Many debate over the date of the first Thanksgiving. Some argue it occurred in 1637 when Governor John Winthrop celebrated the massacre of 900 Pequot indigenous people. Others think it was in 1621. Now the world knows the truth of Thanksgiving. Communities around the world celebrate what they are thankful for while also remembering Thanksgiving\u2019s past. Knowing the horrors of history has inspired people to enlighten others. We must all learn from past mistakes and work to maintain gratitude and peace.

This October, CSArts had a \u201cspooktacular\u201d party of their own by hosting another amazing \u201cSpooky Fest. \u201d The event consisted of many thrilling events such as trunk or treat, club fundraisers, student performances, and a student-directed haunted house! Located out on the field, parents and students decorated their cars with spooky ribbons, pumpkins, and spider webs, with games for students to have a shot at winning sugary treats. In the Quad, clubs held fundraisers, selling food and drinks like boba, root beer floats, and donuts, as well as trinkets like bracelets and plants. On stage, Popular Music, Dance, and Instrumental Music students wowed the crowd with their performances. But the spookiest attraction of all was the haunted house located in the cafeteria. Directed by the Junior Co-Class presidents, the house consisted of students acting as bloody clowns, creepy contortionists, frightening carnival characters, and more. With student-done makeup, decorations, and costumes, the event was a huge hit, and had a line out the door the entire time. Students and adults alike were amazed by the effort and fun of the event.

"},{id:48,url:"https://csartisan.org/online-safety/",title:"Student Online Safety",body:"2023/11/17 - It\u2019s safe to say that the majority of high-schoolers, especially CSArts students, are very active online. Many may feel like their phones are extensions of themselves. It\u2019s easy to become immersed in the whole spectacle and find a sense of community, but it\u2019s becoming easier to stumble upon the darker sides of the web, especially given the current state of the world right now. Keeping yourself safe, prioritizing your mental health, and distancing yourself from the vitriol online is more important now than ever. We at the CSArtisan believe that one should prioritize keeping up to date with current events and educating oneself about global issues, but not at the expense of your mental health and personal comforts. The internet can be used to learn about so much so thoroughly, but it becomes a problem when it affects our collective mental health. It\u2019s vital to be able to critically analyze and evaluate the sources of information or media on the internet. Information on the internet is everywhere, but so is misinformation. The skill to properly evaluate sources and separate fact from opinion is called media literacy. Here\u2019s how you can start: First, ask questions about the content you\u2019re viewing. Who created it, and what\u2019s their agenda? What do they want to convince you of? What kinds of bias might they have? What kind of emotional appeals are they using? Where do they get their information? Second, diversify your sources to gain a broader perspective, and always fact-check information. While having too many sources can be overwhelming, having a variety of sources with different individual biases can be helpful in straining out the important details. It\u2019s also very important to double check for the specific context and date of the information. Third, reduce your exposure to violent or political content. There are many resources to help filter content that may be violent in nature, or generally stress-inducing. Using content filters and parental controls helps limit the amount of potentially violent content on your social media feed, and also helps you unplug generally and focus more on the real world. Fourth, installing ad blockers and content filters is a good idea for any internet user, but especially those who want to avoid potentially troubling content. Your attention on the internet is a very valuable thing, and unfortunately people will go to great lengths to harness it by deliberately promoting provocative or unsettling content to bring in attention. Utilizing ad blockers will not only make your experience on the internet a little less annoying, but it also can protect you from triggering media. Generally, the best way to ensure that you won\u2019t be thrust into any uncomfortable or triggering online media is to be selective in choosing who you connect with online and where you get your information from. We, at the CSArtisan, recognize that times are changing, and it\u2019s scary, but in the face of it all remember that we each have the autonomy to create a better digital sphere and generally make the world a kinder place.

Each year it is also a remembrance to the families and communities of Native Americans who share the history of the celebration. The first Thanksgiving lasted three days and was a banquet of unionizing the Wampanoag tribe and the Pilgrims who arrived from the Mayflower seeking a new life and work in America. On November 23, 1621, when there was roasted corn and vegetables, the Pilgrims betrayed the Wampanoag tribe by stealing their food, land and spreading diseases to the Native Americans. Checking out Indigenous artists\u2019 work during this year\u2019s Native American Heritage Month is an amazing way to show support for the community. Published this year, Leah Myers\u2019 memoir \u201cThinning Blood\u201d speaks on how growing up Native American and the trials and tribulations of the possibility of being the last member of her family to qualify in her tribe.

Your shoes crush candy wrappers scattering the floor, and little kids run by, hands clutching plastic bags full of sweets. Every doorstep is lined with carved pumpkins, skeleton garlands, and light-up ghosts; every lawn is covered with tombstones and zombie hands. People walk around decked out in skulls, masks, and faux bandages, fully immersed in the whirlwind of the holiday. Pretty great, right? Sure. But after the spooky fun, a question arises: pumpkins, costumes, candy\u2026 what happens to all that stuff? In many cases, the answer isn\u2019t as sweet. Take jack o\u2019 lanterns, for example. Out of the people who buy pumpkins to carve them, over half throw them away afterward. According to Hummingbird International, 18,000 tons of pumpkins \u2013 that\u2019s like 360 million portions of pumpkin pie \u2013 are dumped in landfills, and they release methane gas when decomposed, a greenhouse gas that\u2019s around 20 times more harmful to the environment than CO2. But pumpkins aren\u2019t the only thing that end up in landfills. Every year, 35 million Halloween costumes are thrown away. Not only that, but it takes more than half of these costumes 20 to 200 years to decompose. Another problem is that, as mentioned by Commons, many costumes are made from petroleum-based plastics, which use fossil fuels, a non-renewable resource. Along with the costumes, Halloween candy contributes to a significant portion of plastic packaging waste at 30%.  A Californai recycling website says candy wrappers are often made of a mix of materials, like aluminum and plastics, and they\u2019re pretty small. This makes them hard to separate and sort, meaning much of it can\u2019t be recycled. So, how can you help? One way is to find candy that uses reusable or biodegradable packaging, or even a replacement for candy instead, like cookies or oranges with jack o\u2019 lantern faces. You can also repurpose, recycle, or donate your costumes, as less thrown away means less textile waste. Same idea for pumpkins: instead of chucking them, try composting them, cooking them, or feeding them to pets. And remember, these aren\u2019t the only actions you can take to make a change. Being eco-conscious starts with little things like this, but staying eco-conscious takes a little more effort. Those were just a few ways you and your community can help out the environment\u2026 so that next Halloween isn\u2019t such a scare.

That leaves many wondering, what exactly is gratitude? What does it look like? Gratitude is so important in our daily lives, not just on Thanksgiving. The Personal Excellence Foundation explains how gratitude impacts teens in everyday life. Gratitude positively affects learning and mental health and hosts many physical benefits. According to the Mayo Clinic Health System (MCHS), thankfulness should be practiced every day. Gratitude can be found everywhere: a teacher helping a student in class, a cup of coffee in the morning, or a friend cheering someone up when they\u2019re down. Gratitude can also affect sleep, a necessity especially for students staying at school until 5:00! One way to help remind yourself to be thankful is to keep a gratitude journal. MCHS suggests writing down something positive about your day, like hearing your favorite song on the radio, a friend helping you study, or maybe your significant other supporting you in challenging times. People create gratitude lists of seven things they are thankful for. They have to think deeply, about more than only pets or family, but anything meaningful to them. To show thankfulness to others, some may host a Friendsgiving and celebrate with their chosen family. Others invite relatives to share food and thanks. Many of us may be familiar with \u201cTable Sharing,\u201d where everyone at the table shares something they\u2019re grateful for. Some people even write gratitude cards, gifting them to friends, parents, or teachers. They bring positivity into the lives of others while brightening their own.

The maintenance team is working hard to resolve some of the issues and concerns by increasing clean up on campus, landscaping, and frequently deep cleaning our trash cans, as bees are attracted to these areas. \u201d As for what students can do to help with the bee problems, admin says,  Students can do their part by cleaning up after themselves and ensuring that their trash goes into the appropriate receptacles. \u201d Other possible ways to avoid the bees include staying away from the trash cans or using smells that bees don\u2019t like like cloves and peppermint. With work from both the maintenance crew and CSArts students, the bee issues should lesson as we head into colder temperatures and wet weather during the Winter.

The celebrations of culture and history don\u2019t stop there! Hispanic Heritage Month originally started as a week in August, 1968 by President Johnson. In August, 1988 the week was extended to a month (from September 15th to October 15th) by President Reagan. The declaration was created to celebrate Hispanic/Latino independence days and culture with parades, traditional foods, and parties. The celebration recognizes the 64 million Americans of Hispanic/Latino descent, and their important historical contributions. From political activism, to art, to entreprenuership, Hispanics and Latinos from the U. S have shaped the country into what it is today. Throughout the month, corporations like Starbucks, Target, and Barnes and Noble have participated in Hispanic Heritage month by promoting and incorporating the work of Latino and Hispanic people into their products. Barnes and Noble dedicated a wall specifically for books written by Hispanic authors, while companies like Starbucks and Target released merchandise specifically created by Hispanic artists. At CSArts, Spanish teachers design special lessons during the month in order to teach students about the many different cultures and traditions surrounding people of Hispanic and Latin origin. AP Spanish teacher Andrea Nelson, says the designated month gives students a break from exams, and gives them insight into the culture and the important role the Hispanic and Latino community plays in the U. S.  Recognition and celebration are a good starting point for our year round focus on Latino culture. Two aspects are most important for AP Spanish, Spanish 4 Honors and Spanish 3 Honors: we celebrate by using the language as a means of communication and develop cultural appreciation for Latino influences around the world. \u201d The learning experience isn\u2019t just focused on books. Students passing by Spanish classrooms in the 400\u2019s will hear music and the sounds of students competing as they play Spanish games in order to deepen their understanding and appreciation of the language and culture. The celebration doesn\u2019t end there! Just weeks after the end of Hispanic Heritage Month, El Dia de los Muertos will begin, honoring and celebrating the lives of those who have passed away. There are many traditions, holidays, and events etched into Hispanic and Latino culture that are worth celebrating and recognizing, as they have such a large impact on the U. S too. To learn more and connect with Hispanic and Latin culture, feel free to pass by a Spanish classroom, visit a LUCHA meeting, or even just watch some classic telenovelas!

Week after week, the campus heard a variety of tunes, leaving many students wondering what tune would be assaulting their ears next. Some students like the change, but their opinion doesn\u2019t matter. The majority hate it, like Braedon Younger (CW \u201824). He expressed:  The bell is gonna make me rip out my ears. \u201d Agreeing with Younger\u2019s opinion, students add on that it sounds like the intune of a popular kid\u2019s YouTube channel, Cocomelon. \xa0 The CSArtisan asked the assistant principal, Mrs. Read, to clarify the bell situation.  The PA system works better with a wireless system so that the little chime that [used to] happen at the end of the blocks doesn\u2019t reach\u2026 the 400s\u2026[the tune is] too short so we have to elongate it. \u201d Due to this, Admin experimented with different audios, that came as default tunes with the wireless system such as ones that sounded like a chorus of trumpets, a bass-booted C# note, and a literal fire alarm. In the end, Mrs. Read chose the current bell because of its simplicity and long enough tune. It was not intentionally made to sound like Cocomelon, it was just an arpeggio that came with the default sound pack. If you hate it that much, Mrs. Read did mention that there might be a contest near the end of the year to determine the new bell:  If you want to just spread the word that that\u2019ll be a possibility in the spring, people can start composing whatever they want [for the bell]. \u201d\xa0 "},{id:57,url:"https://csartisan.org/telltale-bell/",title:"Telltale Bell",body:"2023/10/20 - It is impossible to say how the idea first entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. \u2018Twas a lonely and slow evening when that idea first formulated, a thought that I wish never entered my twisted mind; to replace our old bell with a new ring. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old bell. You fancy me mad. I know the old bell is no more and I am the one responsible for its demise.

"},{id:59,url:"https://csartisan.org/security-at-school/",title:"Security at School",body:"2023/10/20 - School security dominates national headlines. Concerns about rising rates of violence across the country have led to the implementation of new policies to keep students, teachers and staff safe. This includes practicing emergency drills, educating students on what to look for, and implementing technology to enhance safety around campuses. But what does school safety look like at CSArts? School-wide drills prepare students and staff on what to do and where to go in emergency situations. Staff is also trained in overdose prevention, including the safe administration of Narcan.  As administrators we\u2019re trained in various ways, CPR and First Aid, and we have a nurse. If things are happening, we\u2019ve been trained on how to respond,\u201d assistant Principal, Nicole Read, said. CSArts continues its dedication to campus safety by contracting security staff. The presence of security guards, according to Read, increases the safety and security of the campus, as they can directly identify and manage any kind of internal/external security threats.  Say Cheese, students! You are on camera!\u201d Security cameras are peppered around campus and school administrators say these additions are instrumental in maintaining security. The video cameras provide visuals and double -check student or staff observations of potential security breaches.  We typically have only used them after the fact. So if something is reported and we have to do an investigation, we pull out footage\u2026we can go back and get the information,\u201d Read said. Recently, the school implemented a new form of surveillance that uses live-streaming. The hub for these cameras is in Mr. Metoyer\u2019s office, in the form of a big screen above Mr. Metoyer\u2019s door. The cameras, video and live streamed, in tandem with the other security measures are instrumental in addressing real-time security concerns on campus.  Mr Metoyer saw some people behind the 400s\u2026that didn\u2019t look like students, and it turned out to be parents on some kind of a tour, but it was like- what\u2019s going on? So he radioed security and they checked in,\u201d Read said. While in that instance there were no problems, students and staff should know that the combination of training, staff security, bathroom sensors and the newest technology is keeping The CSArts campus safe. Students are taking notice of the new additions.  I feel that the emergency stations on campus are a great idea. Drugs are becoming a big problem in school,\u201d said one freshman student. The promotion and access to resources on assessing an overdose-related situation is essential, and will ensure that if there is an overdose on campus, there are people with training and Narcan to save a life. While students and school administrators are trained and equipped, school security also relies on students. Students are here for the longest amount of time, and can more easily detect when something might be happening. That\u2019s why CSArts depends on the student body to use the resources available. If you see something, say something! CSArts also has a text-to-tip number that you can use 24 hours a day at 626-531-1271.

Each year students take simple craft pumpkins home and bring back incredible pieces of art, all part of CSArt\u2019s annual Painted Pumpkin Auction. This year, students came up with a wide variety of innovative designs. Some were sculpted, stacked, hollowed out; some were big, some small, some even sideways.

Students used paint, clay, glue, and paper to transform the gourds into \u201cgourd\u201d-geously wicked art pieces.

body:"2023/10/20 - CSArts was built on a foundation of creativity where art meets scholastics. From academics to conservatory, CSArts uses a different approach to learning. Students throughout Los Angeles and Orange Counties brave long commutes because of the many opportunities CSArts offers. The CSArts conservatory doesn\u2019t just attract students, it attracts instructors interested in sharing their knowledge and talents Before coming to CSArts to work as a creative writing instructor, Pasha McKenley worked at two other schools. She taught young children plays and monologues. Her students performed onstage, and those performances ignited a passion in other students throughout the school! From plays to monologues, students took advantage of this new opportunity to share their voices through acting and performing. Students even got the change to perform their own works in slam poetry.  Usually, I was the person bringing creativity to the schools,\u201d McKenly said. This not only increased passion in students for the arts, it also helped improve communication among students and their peers, and improved the culture of the school. Hearing about CSArts, McKenley thought the opportunity to work in a school that focused on the arts would be a good fit. After her first visit, she knew she was meant to teach at CSArts.  There was some guy playing the violin and there were girls tap dancing over there\u2026 I was like, where am I? Like on this island of bliss?\u201d While most schools offer artistic opportunites, not all encourage students to follow creative paths. Creative Writing Conservatory Director Timothy Gomez taught at many different schools, each with different ways of incorporating creativity. Gomez said that one middle school where he taught had a decent theater and visual arts program, but that it was limited.  They ended up de-prioritizing their creative skills and finding more traditional pathways, while only exploring their art as a hobby. Or some of our most talented artists ending up leaving our school and going elsewhere to a school that could prioritize their creativity and had the resources for it. \u201d CSArts prioritized creativity for students and teachers, which led Gomez here last Summer.  I see a real social comfort here that I didn\u2019t see at my other schools. Students feel fully safe to be themselves and explore who they are, and I think this is a product of allowing them to explore their creative lives more fully. I wanted to engage more with my creative life. At CSArts, I get to have the freedom to explore the exact kind of material that I\u2019d like to with my students. And I get to value their creative work in the exact ways that I think matters. \u201d CSArts continues to attract students and teachers alike because it offers a blank canvas and the tools for success in both academics and conservatory. This balance of art and scholastics continues to produce students who are prepared for their next chapter after graduation.

You probably haven\u2019t, which is why we need to raise awareness and educate the people around us. It is crucial for the community to recognize the tragic impacts of this blockade on the Armenian people of Artsakh. Azerbaijan is responsible for the blockade in Artsakh. This oppression of Armenia and Artsakh has existed for too many decades. Turkey and Azerbaijan have teamed together to ethnically cleanse all of Armenia and Artsakh from Armenians. This blockade ran for 9 months and cut Armenians off from the rest of the world and from getting any resources from outside, such as food, medical supplies, and more. Azerbejian even blocked the Lachin Corridor, which is also known as the lifeline of people living in Artsakh. It is the only way people living in Artsakh could get resources. This caused starvation and medical complications, and many innocent people died because of this. The constant refusal of Azerbaijan to lift the blockade violates basic human rights. They are continuing this oppression of Armenians from the Armenian Genocide in 1915, where 1. 2 million Armenians were killed at the Ottoman Empire\u2019s hand. Which is a genocide that Turkey has refused to admit they were responsible for, and spent thousands of dollars to cover it up by paying journalists and news channels to report the Armenian Genocide never happened. Last month, Azerbaijan bombed Artsakh using drones and missile strikes, bombing civilian areas like schools and churches, while their soldiers destroyed cultural sites and artifacts. Azerbaijan soldiers have even gone as far as posting videos of them shooting innocent civilians and destroying graves while laughing. Armenians are being killed by Azerbaijan and Turkey for the reason of them being Armenians. This ethnic cleansing of the people in the Armenian land of Artsakh by Azerbaijan(which is backed by Turkey) needs to end. Turkey and Azerbaijan have targeted Armenians solely based on ethnic hatred. And now, for the first time in 5,000 years, no Armenians remain in Artsakh. It is time to recognize these events and end them so there can be peace in the region. How does this relate to us today? Los Angeles has the largest Armenian population in the U. S. Armenian students at CSArts in the Armenian Student Union (ASU) have been doing everything in the hopes of saving their ancestral land and preventing another genocide. How can you help?: The club is available for anyone to join; it\u2019s for anyone who is interested in helping and advocating for this issue. ASU has been sending emails to government officials in hopes of flooding their inboxes until they have no choice but to help. Any student here that is interested in joining will be an amazing help in making a difference. Simply by reading this article, more people have been educated so this event in history is remembered. ANCA is an organization working to get the U. S. to help its Armenian community and sanction the Azerbaijan government for its crimes.

The CSArtisan talked with Mr. Gomez about his passion for writing, his responsibilities as director, and possible future plans. Why do you enjoy writing?:  For me, I got into writing when I was in high school and I really loved it because I was going through a lot in high school, a lot of stuff that I didn\u2019t understand and writing was like the one thing that allowed me to process because I didn\u2019t go to therapy or anything back then. It wasn\u2019t as common to go to therapy, so writing was my therapy. I wrote a lot of journals and I started getting into poetry. I got really into music lyrics and confessional music. That became a way for me to put words to things that I was feeling at a time when I had a hard time processing what I was going through. \u201d What advice would you give for other writers?:  The times where I\u2019ve been the most productive is when I had deadlines, even if they\u2019re self-imposed. Something that I did when I was at Sarah Lawrence is we did Open Mics every week, so I told myself that every week I was going to read something and it had to be something new. \u201d How has it been so far being the new creative writing director?:  I love it so far. I mean, I\u2019m coming from a very public school background where I started teaching just regular English and history and so I didn\u2019t get to really focus on creativity at all. It was all academic essays, writing arguments, informative essays, and teaching kids how to research, which is stuff I love, but I very rarely go to do creative writing work with my kids.  And so getting to focus on that has been amazing. All the kids here are so talented and getting to hear all of your guys\u2019 work and getting to hear the kind of stuff that you guys write about and getting to see what you guys care about in terms of what kind of classes you want to have next spring has been amazing. Then I also love that I still get to teach. The fact that I get to do a lot of outside of school work, like running the events, getting master artists, and checking on classes has been really fun. \u201d What are you looking forward to most this year?:  Sugar Pine. I think I worked on the literary journal at Sarah Lawrence when I was a student there and so I know how much and how much I don\u2019t know how enlightening it can be to get all of these submissions from all of these different students and go through them and decide what goes in and then having this product at the end where a bunch of our students get to say, \u2018Hey, I was printed in this really beautiful book. \u2019 It\u2019s such a good feeling and I\u2019m excited for that. \u201d What future plans do you have for Creative Writing?:  I\u2019m hoping to do smaller publications through throughout the year. I want to do a horror- zine next month and in addition to doing the bigger Sugar Pine thing, I want to do a bunch of smaller self-published work. Do some more magazines with different themes and where the kids submit pieces and it\u2019s not as edited. \u201d Anything else you want to add?:  It\u2019s been about a month of school so far already and it\u2019s been so far already and it\u2019s been so fun. I love being on campus here and we had the Open Mic night last week and getting to see all your work was super fun. It\u2019s just getting to spend time with you guys and get to know you guys and understand you as writers and it\u2019s been really fulfilling, so I\u2019m excited.

We ask all kinds of questions to get a sense of what venues can host our school. \u201d The Fairplex is covered with gardens of peppers and pumpkins, country decor, and a wonderfully rustic atmosphere \u2013 the perfect setting for a hoedown.

It wouldn\u2019t make sense to have done [another] theme\u2026 because the venue wouldn\u2019t have allowed for that theme. It would have contrasted. \u201d The theme was decided by the entire class before moving forward with the dance preparation.  [Since] the venue was already picked out for us, we just planned accordingly. We all came to an agreement before starting to plan,\u201d says Alyssa Cho (10th grade, Visual Arts), one of the leadership students. The homecoming decorations emphasized the country qualities of the venue.  We take inspiration from the Pinterest board we created for the dance. Then some of us made an Amazon wishlist of decorations for the admin to order,\u201d says Kaelin Lee, (11th grade, Acting), another of the leadership students.  Decorations were also made, incorporating the creativity of the committee members. The whole process was extremely enjoyable!\u201d Planning any event \u2013 especially a school dance \u2013 has its difficulties. Preparing for such an eventful occasion could be stressful. However, a student in the leadership class says otherwise:  It was overall a really cool experience \u2013 it was the first project of the year we worked on as a team. I felt really connected and we all kind of helped each other throughout the process,\u201d says Alyssa Cho. Since hoco hoedown was the first project, it\u2019s something that will be memorable to the students of the leadership class.  The planning process was easy, with great guidance from the dance coordinators, and the division of work ensured we were on task and everyone was doing something they liked,\u201d says Kaelin Lee. The leadership committee does so much for CSArts: they make sure all of our dances and events are as enjoyable as possible. Homecoming was a great start to a wonderful year of events \u2013 we now patiently anticipate the upcoming winter formal and prom. Leadership made hoco as magical as possible!

With new classes, homework, and conservatory activities, it\u2019s important for students to remember self-care.  Luckily, the school has lots of resources available to make sure you are physically and emotionally well! A brand newly designed Wellness Center is in Room 111, and The CSArtisan reached out to Mrs. Alisha Miranda, special services faculty member, to answer some questions about it! What resources does the Wellness Center provide for students?: The Wellness Center, open Monday through Friday from 8:15am-2:15pm, is designed to be a quiet space, where students can relax and decompress for a few minutes. Students are invited to rest or meditate, read, color or draw, use a relaxation or fidget tool, speak with a counselor, practice evidence-based coping strategies, research wellness topics, listen to music, take a walk, stretch/yoga, do guided breathing, and stay for 20 minutes to utilize all of these resources and more. How can students without a 504 or IEP access the Wellness Center?: Students MUST have a Wellness Center Pass from their teacher, counselor, or another CSArts staff member in order to be admitted into the Wellness Center. You do not need a pass if you are visiting before school or in between classes. In what situations would the Wellness Center be of help to a student?: There are various situations that might cause a student to need to utilize the Wellness Center.  For example, panic/anxiety attacks, depression, restlessness, low motivation, mental health disorders, counseling and guidance, general anxiety, meditation, brain break, or loss of focus. Want to help out? The Wellness Center is accepting donations. To find out more, students and/or guardians can contact Mrs. Miranda via email at alisha. miranda@sgv. csarts. net.

Then complete anything you can while you have time. Just making the most of what you can with the time you got\u201d  Kayla Rigo (IM, \u201825) Before my first tech week I wished I knew how little sleep you would actually be getting so definitely take time to rest and recharge. Also, I wish I knew that other people are in the same boat as me. We both don\u2019t know the material or where rehearsal will go. You end up making new friends you never thought you would even speak to. \u201d  Ines Arroyo (MT, \u201825)It is all about balance and using time wisely.

"},{id:71,url:"https://csartisan.org/sensors-in-the-bathrooms/",title:"Sensors in the Bathrooms",body:"2023/09/25 - One of the most talked about, and perhaps most controversial new additions to the CSArts campus, are bathroom sensors. Students and faculty have many questions about the new technology. The CSArtisan talked with CSArts Principal Dr. Gregory Endelman for details what they do, and why they are needed. First and foremost, students, parents, and teachers have been pushing for ways to make the campus safe from drugs.  This has actually been an ongoing conversation that really has been led mostly by the students, and then their families. Students in various forms have been reporting that they would like the bathrooms to be drug free. \u201d Last year\u2019s campus-wide lockdown brought student safety into focus.  Some of the students were asking, \u2018Can we have a panic button?\u2019 So we looked into a variety of options. And these detection devices were recommended to us,\u201d Endelman said. The sensors have two main jobs: to pick up on smells and sounds.  They detect chemicals in the air that are associated with tobacco products and marijuana products. It also has the capability to detect certain threats. It\u2019s not recording what students are saying in the bathroom \u2026[but] if there\u2019s something happening in the bathroom that spikes noise, it\u2019s going to alert administration\u201d Endelman said. You can thank AI for this new technology.  The way that they are designed, it\u2019s a form of artificial intelligence, and they get hosted by these third parties, through a server. So they\u2019re internet connected. And they do that so they can constantly install updates. But I do suspect that as technology evolves, these things are going to become very, very sophisticated. \u201d This safety net, while keeping the campus safe, is expensive.  Each device itself is about $1,500 \u2026 but this is not like \u2026 putting batteries in a regular smoke detector. They have to be wired. They have to be linked to the internet, and they have to be hosted. So the installation for the devices run around $30,000- $60,000. It\u2019s a substantial investment. But it\u2019s one of those things that we \u2026 think is important,\u201d Endelman said. While you may not be able to see the sensors, they are installed, working, and adding a new layer of protection on campus. "},{id:72,url:"https://csartisan.org/psat-cancelled/",title:"CSArts PSAT Cancelled",body:"2023/09/25 - As more colleges and universities shift away from standardized testing for admission criteria, CSArts decided on a shift as well. Part of that decision meant The PSAT was canceled. CSArts administrators and counselors cut the PSAT due to declining student interest and the financial strain it put on the school. The cancellation has raised concerns by students and parents because the PSAT provides helpful practice for the SAT, and high scores on the practice test can qualify students for merit awards and thousands of dollars in scholarships. By the time the cancellation was announced and CSArts families started to raise concerns, administrators said that they were, \u201cbeyond all of College Board\u2019s deadlines for establishing our school\u2019s PSAT administration, ordering exams, collecting payment, and registering students to test. \u201d This resulted in many students scrambling to find a solution, mostly looking to other local schools. The problem, however, is that many schools don\u2019t allow outside students to take the test. CSArts is in the process of talking with Duarte Unified to figure out a solution. Duarte Unified has offered to register students and host the PSAT for CSArts students. The details of the deal between CSArts and Duarte are still being worked out. The CSArtisan asked student counselor, Ms. McMillen, what students could do as an alternative in order to be eligible for scholarships similar to The National Merit Scholarship. McMillen said that students can find other scholarship resources updated monthly on Student Square in the \u201cyour counselor section. \u201d The issues regarding future standardized testing at CSArts and nationally raises important questions regarding the importance of tests for college admissions and the impact on student opportunities. It should also serve as a reminder of the necessity for clear dialogue between administrators and students regarding the changing landscape. Although the PSAT may be less important for college admission, there are still valuable opportunities for students that must be considered.

body:"2023/09/25 - New schedules, new classes, new teachers, college essays, APs, the list of what a new school year entails goes on and on. It\u2019s scary; it\u2019s stressful; it\u2019s overwhelming, and it\u2019s a lot of work. However, it can be manageable. All it takes is a little bit of guidance, and the making of some good habits. The CSArtisan has the top 4 tips and tricks to have a productive and stress free school year, brought to you by one of CSArts\u2019 very own school counselors, Ms. Christy. Tip #1: Make to-do lists and take it one step at a time!: With deadlines approaching and assignments piling up, it can be hard to not get overwhelmed. Sometimes, big to-do lists can be astonishingly long, and so it can be helpful to \u201cprioritize in terms of what\u2019s urgent and most important, and then make a smaller to-do list\u2026 starting with little chunks,\u201d Christy says. By separating your to-dos into smaller chunks, breaking it into a more manageable manner, motivation can be boosted, and, \u201cIt can make you feel more accomplished and increase focus because you feel like you\u2019re actually getting something done. \u201d Tip #2: Use a planner or other organizational tools!: With Seniors being faced with the challenging task of college applications, Freshmen still adapting to the ropes of highschool, and other students being thrown into the new schedules and classes that come with starting a new grade, it can be difficult to stay organized. One tip that Ms. Christy has is to \u201chave a blue day and a gold day binder\u201d or a planner to keep the two schedules separated. For Seniors, Christy suggests that \u201cgetting organized first is one of the best things that you can do. This is a really great time to get organized because deadlines aren\u2019t quite happening yet. \u201d It can be really helpful to create \u201cExcel sheets, or some kind of organizer or trackers of all the schools that you want to apply to, and then all the upcoming application materials that you need\u201d so that it can all be in the same place. Tip #3: Utilize office hours!:  Utilizing office hours is going to be one of the most helpful things that you can do here at CSArts. \u201d Christy says. With many schools not offering one-on-one time for students to interact with teachers, office hours can be an incredibly helpful tool.  Utilizing even 25 minutes twice a week can be a really great opportunity to get some studying done, rather than waiting till you get home. \u201d Tip #4: Take care of yourself and don\u2019t forget to have fun!: Starting a new school year can be stressful and draining for everyone. CSArts requires a lot of hard work and dedication, and the school days are long.  I always recommend making sure to get enough sleep,\u201d Christy says.  That\u2019s when our brain grows the most, when you\u2019re of this age. \u201d It\u2019s also very important to \u201cbring plenty of snacks for conservatory and utilize office hours to get some homework done. \u201d Social aspects are also vital in having a productive and fun school year, and so Ms. Christy suggests getting involved in some of the many clubs at CSArts. Finding other people to bond over similar interests can be really helpful, especially for Freshmen and other new students. Also, don\u2019t forget that you don\u2019t have to sign up to a club right away at Club Rush, you can still join any time! For more information or advice, contact your school counselor, Ms. Shiroma (grades 9-11, A-F, and grade 12, A-G), Ms. Christy (grades 9-11, G-M, and grade 12, H-O), or Ms. McMillen (grades 9-11, N-Z, and grade 12, P-Z) "},{id:75,url:"https://csartisan.org/club-rush-2023/",title:"Club Rush 2023",body:"2023/09/25 - With the first few weeks of school starting to settle, student and teacher-run clubs come together to provide opportunities for service hours, experience for college applications and just plain fun!

"},{id:76,url:"https://csartisan.org/classy-classrooms/",title:"Classy Classrooms",body:"2023/09/25 - The creative classrooms of CSArts reflect our unique student body. From math classes to Mandarin 1, the academic classes are just as inventive as conservatory courses. Teachers shape their lesson plans to fit their specific goals of the class; it is rare to find two classes that are exactly the same. The creativity of teachers is apparent in their classrooms. In Room 101, the walls of Mr. Bowman\u2019s classroom are covered with posters, student work, and shelves of mementos.  Keeping someone\u2019s attention for a full ninety minutes can be really difficult. When students start to space out, they can find something in the room that interests them. Wherever they look, there\u2019s something to see,\u201d says Mr. Bowman. His classroom is famous for its calm environment, stock of emergency granola bars, and other essential supplies available for all students.  I want it to be a welcoming space; that\u2019s my goal. \u201d Just a few doors down is Mr. Y\u2019s math class in Room 105, where his students try to fill the \u201cmistake counter\u201d by spotting any mistakes in his lesson.  I think it keeps them a little sharper and more focused,\u201d says Mr. Y.  Every year [the students] get more and more creative with finding math mistakes. \u201d Many of Mr. Y\u2019s students also know of the xylophone in his classroom, which he originally received as a gift.  I thought it was a strange gift, so I thought it\u2019d be even stranger to bring it to school,\u201d he says.  I like to play children\u2019s songs, like the one about the lamb. Someone had a little lamb. \u201d However, creativity isn\u2019t always shown through physical objects and settings. It can also be shown in the ways teachers manage their classrooms. In Mandarin 1, which is located in Room 401, most of the vocabulary isn\u2019t pre-planned. Instead, the teacher, Nana Yang, asks the students questions such as what they did on their weekend. She translates their response into Mandarin Chinese. This results in a lot of varied vocabulary. She says that she was inspired by how parents used to ask questions to their children to teach them Chinese.  A lot of times the questions are based off of daily life,\u201d she explained.  So most of [the] topics [we learn in class] are based on real life situations. \u201d Mr. Pegan, who teaches Early World History in Room 301, also has an interesting approach to teaching. The questions on his assignments have to do with forming an opinion about the topic, not memorizing historical facts like you would expect.  A lot of highschool math or a lot of highschool history isn\u2019t driven as much by being able to remember names and dates,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s driven by using historical facts to make an argument. \u201d Also, Mr. Pegan doesn\u2019t lecture for most of the class. Instead, he gives the students nearly all of class time to work on assignments. When asked why he made this choice, he said,  Lecture\u2019s a more passive form of teaching. By having you dig in and having to do all the work, you\u2019re the center of the learning. \u201d He added that this also gives him time to answer questions and help students with the assignment. These are only a few examples of how CSArts is a school where both students and teachers can express their creativity. These teachers choose to make creative or pleasant classrooms all over the CSArts campus, whether this is through aesthetic decorations and physical objects, or the way they manage their classroom. Every teacher gives their students the opportunity to learn and grow in a unique environment. "},{id:77,url:"https://csartisan.org/chromebook-creeper-or-helper/",title:"Chromebook Creeper or Helper?",body:"2023/09/25 - As schools begin to embrace the digital age, teachers find their own ways to combat distractions and make sure students stay on task. Imagine, you\u2019re sitting in your English class, writing a long, tedious essay. Leaning back in your chair, you stifle a groan. You feel you\u2019ve worked hard for a solid 30 minutes, and deserve a break. You glance towards your teacher who seems to be paying no mind to what you\u2019re doing, too engrossed in their own matters. You move your cursor across the tabs, switching to one you feel will offer more entertainment, but before you can truly engage with it, you\u2019re met once again with your English essay. Looking back at your teacher, they peer at you with a cunning glare. You know then, with absolute certainty this is none other than the work of GoGuardian. As of the 2023 school year, CSArts has decided to implement GoGuardian into the classroom. GoGuardian is an educational technology company that allows teachers to monitor their students\u2019 online activity, filter content, and alert school officials of threatening (either to self or other) behaviors on the district owned chromebooks. It is primarily used as a monitoring service to help students stay focused and engaged with their classroom tasks. Michael Turf, a history teacher at CSArts welcomes the new system into his classroom this year.  It\u2019s a brand-new system that the school is using and a bit of an adjustment period, but I am happy the school is investing in programs that support students and teachers in the classroom. \u201d  GoGuardian was brought on board to help with staying focused and provide students with some focus and guidance from these distractive behaviors. Especially teaching AP classes, classroom time is extremely valuable, and GoGuardian allows me to monitor student computer behaviors and provide interventions throughout class time. GoGuardian provides a platform for me to intervene without calling attention to a specific student in front of the Class, \u201d said Turf. A student in Ms. Nelson\u2019s class also agrees that GoGuardian can be helpful.  The only teacher that I have that uses it is my Spanish teacher. She uses it all the time so I think she likes it. I don\u2019t really mind it. It keeps me on track and forces me to do my work. \u201d Not Everyone Is A Fan: While monitoring all students\u2019 screens may make it easier for teachers to intervene, is constant supervision the best route to take? While teachers do think that it is helpful for classroom control, students might not like the idea of being monitored for doing their work.  I think it can enhance classroom productivity,\u201d Emma Thompson, an English teacher who decided not to use the monitoring application says,  but it can also create tension in a classroom. \u201c Students had different opinions on the use of GoGuardian.  It used to bother me (especially in elementary school) when I would want to play online games instead of working in class,\u201d One student said.  But now I have to admit it\u2019s good for staying on task and preventing people from cheating during tests,\u201d said one anonymous student. Another student argues that it causes them stress in class, disrupting their work time.  Sometimes I feel like I have to pretend that I\u2019m doing my work even though I\u2019m actually doing my work. \u201d "},{id:78,url:"https://csartisan.org/thank-you-class-presidents/",title:"Thank You Class Presidents!",body:"2023/05/19 - As the school year comes to an end, it\u2019s important to recognize some people who helped us make this year so fun.

We had so much fun coming together as a class, especially with the knowledge that we would gather once more for Senior Sunset, months later.

For Halloween, we wanted to do something of our own for the school, so we had seniors drive their cars onto the field and host games out of the trunks. Executing ideas is exhilarating because it\u2019s like seeing your Pinterest board brought to life! Class of 2023, you are amazing.

We got this!\u201d  Hannah Pung (BCD \u201824)A message from one of your Class of 2025 co-presidents::  My favorite part about being this year\u2019s class president is honestly wearing the maid dress after getting elected. As well as just being able to represent your class is really nice. My advice to any future presidents is that it\u2019s important to be yourself and to do it all for your class and not yourself, have fun too! And I\u2019d just like to say that the Class of 2025 is honestly the best class!\u201d  Giovanni Huang (P&amp;D \u201825)A message from your Class of 2026 co-presidents::  It was a bit difficult to learn how to manage to fit in time for planning and discussion into a jam-packed schedule. Our favorite moment from the year was the first pep rally of the year. We loved seeing everyone so determined and working together on the games. Most importantly, cheering for our fellow classmates was really nice to be a part of. As for advice to future presidents, iron out your schedule for the year, sit down and review your calendar with your partner, and plan! Myself and Zakai have loved building relationships with the class; learning about each and every one of you has been amazing. We are going to finish the year strong with Clash of Classes and run head first into sophomore year!!!\u201d  Francis Fontana (MT \u201826) and Zakai Haynes (MT \u201826)The CSArtisan sends out a special thank you to all of our class presidents for their hard work and dedication!

"},{id:79,url:"https://csartisan.org/so-long-sugarpine/",title:"So Long, Sugarpine!",body:"2023/05/19 - Every year, the CSArts conservatory closes the season with a showcase highlighting their artistic abilities, whether it be performances or galleries. Among the flurry of end-of-the-year recitals and art exhibitions, the Creative Writing Conservatory quietly says goodbye through their respective niche: in the pages of a book. Sugar Pine Literary Magazine is CSArts\u2019s official literary magazine, operated and edited by Creative Writing Conservatory students. Sugar Pine is a collaborative effort that allows students in each conservatory to express themselves without the confines of artistic factions. Every year, students are encouraged to submit their creative works, ranging from paintings, short stories, and poetry, to photography of any subject, spanning from dancers to set designs. My experience with Sugar Pine began in ninth grade. I went in not knowing much about the class I had signed up for, but excited at the promise that I would get to assist in creating a published piece of work. My naivety was a blessing because I experienced Sugar Pine without expectations, receiving an honest look into what made our magazine so special. Typically dominated by seniors, Sugar Pine is almost always intimidating for younger students. For me, being around more experienced peers was intimidating; however, once I saw how welcoming and helpful they were, I quickly became infatuated with the dedication of a team as spectacular as the Sugar Pine staff. The staff operates with the utmost respect and care for each other, collaborating and discussing frequently to create a beautiful result. I am now a senior, and I have had the honor of being a prose team editor, facilitating group discussions and working with fellow editors to organize each submission into a beautiful magazine. As I prepare to graduate in a few weeks, my heart is filled with memories from my four years at CSArts, and I am forever grateful that the Sugar Pine family fills the bulk of that space. Sugar Pine has been the highlight of my high school experience, and I hope it can recreate that same sense of fulfillment for future creative writing students and aspiring editors. As thrilling and dynamic as room 210\u2019s editorial space is, none of our beloved magazines could have been possible without the excellent guidance of Sugar Pine\u2019s faculty advisor, Mrs. Estella Ramirez. An endless source of support and positivity for every student involved, Mrs. Ramirez\u2019s dedication toward her students\u2014and Sugar Pine as a whole\u2014made the experience gratifying. This year was Mrs. Ramirez\u2019s last as the advisor for Sugar Pine and there\u2019s no denying she and every student working on the magazine put in the effort to make Volume 6 the best, most beautiful issue yet. On behalf of all Sugar Pine staff, past and present, we extend our gratitude to Mrs. Ramirez for her kindness, encouragement, and compassion throughout our journeys in the conservatory. You have left a lasting impact on every student in the Creative Writing Conservatory in such an impactful, memorable way, and we are all filled with gratitude for the years we\u2019ve spent under your wings.

"},{id:81,url:"https://csartisan.org/mr-blaylock/",title:"Memories with Mr. Blaylock",body:"2023/05/19 - Mr. Blaylock embodies all that is good about our school. His positive energy, boundless enthusiasm, deep commitment to excellence, endless creativity, and heart-felt dedication to his students all reflect the best possible qualities of a director of a program at an arts school. Commitment to the development of students\u2019 artistic talents is in Mr. Blaylock\u2019s DNA. His father, James Blaylock, started the creative writing program at OCSOA. Both programs are modeled after graduate-level Masters of Fine Arts programs, and their depth and breadth are incredibly impressive. There are few programs like it in the entire country. The creative writing curriculum developed by Mr. Blaylock has exposed students to a wide variety of writing styles over the course of the program. He brought in a wide array of writers for our master classes. He developed a relationship with Citrus College so that we could have access to college-level conservatory classes. He helped us produce an amazing literary magazine, Sugarpine, every year. Mr. Blaylock developed creative writing classes that served needs in the community\u2013 the Creative Nonfiction class connected students with their elders at a local senior center, and the Theatre for Young Audiences course introduced students to elementary school students. Open-mic nights gave students the opportunity to share their work with others, not just at school, but at Vroman\u2019s Bookstore in Pasadena. Mr. Blaylock has been loved by not only the creative writing conservatory students\u2013 he has fans from every other conservatory on campus. This is no accident.  Mr. Blaylock has always been very intentional about reaching across conservatory lines, as is evidenced in the mini-musicals program and the Peter Pan class. Students have been eager to share their fondest memories of Mr. Blaylock. One of Levvy Butler\u2019s (CW \u201825) fondest memories with him took place after school,  I came in to talk to him about something he was working on and he explained it to me, and I didn\u2019t feel like I was being talked down to at all. He mentioned a part that he was struggling to figure out, and it was really cool to see that he was a normal person who was looking for solutions to things in his writing, the same as me. \u201d Julia Pilch (CW \u201824) loved hearing about Mr. Blaylock\u2019s childhood stories. One of her favorite ones was when he was talking about Mr. Fish, a character he made up.  He and his friends had passes to Disneyland and one summer they would go around saying \u201cvote for Mr. Fish!\u201d and then all of the workers would be confused. But eventually, all of the workers recognized him and would do a fishlike motion when he walked by. \u201d Sevana Zadoian\u2019s (CW \u201823) favorite memory was the senior showcase she and her classmates put on,  He worked really hard to give us the best possible experience and send off in our last year. \u201d Samantha Thomas\u2019s (CW \u201824) favorite memory of Mr. Blaylock was one of his classes\u2013  Whenever I\u2019m in a Blaylock class, there always comes a point where his lectures and our discussions take turns into more introspective territories, and this was especially true in our Peter Pan class last semester. I feel like Mr. Blaylock has such a connection and command of childhood and youth which were the central themes of the class. You can always tell how much he loves talking about how childhood and youth reflect so much of ourselves. I feel like we as teenagers often want to keep fragments of childhood with us, but also want to appear mature. And Blaylock really has always provided such a space to be mature and have beautiful conversations about life while also keeping this glow of youth about everything. I feel like Blaylock understands us.  Never have I had a teacher that truly understands and emphasizes the process of growing up. You can tell how much he loved teaching that class and how much he wanted us to get out of it. From him letting us play dress up and create stories from photographs, it was the blend of fun, passion, and heart that made Neverland one of the most fun classes I\u2019ve ever taken. \u201d Mr. Blaylock\u2019s friendly presence as conservatory director is cherished by everyone, students and faculty alike. We all are thankful for the memories we have made with him and are so excited to see what\u2019s in store for him in the future, whether here at CSArts or somewhere else entirely. Thanks for everything, Mr. Blaylock. "},{id:82,url:"https://csartisan.org/VA-senior-showcase/",title:"Senior VA Art Showcase",body:"2023/05/19 - On May 6th, the cafeteria at CSArts was transformed into an art gallery, as the seniors of the Visual Arts Conservatory held their final showcase, exhibiting their best works that they have created throughout this year and their time at CSArts. From ceramics to acrylic paint, to even mixed media, the seniors were able to discuss their work with others and their artistic journey, and what the future has in store for them as this school year comes to a close. When it came to actually selecting the work they wanted to display, the seniors debated on the pieces they were most proud of.  I knew that I wanted to showcase work from different years that I\u2019ve been at CSArts,\u201d said Rosie Williams (VA \u201823)  I was able to pull things from a few different places and I\u2019m really happy with how it came out! I found a piece in my garage from my sophomore year that I completely forgot about and I am really glad that I was able to put that in there. \u201d  The process of selecting works for the exhibition for me was mainly just looking through all of my sketchbooks and art pieces and deciding which of them would go with the vibe I wanted. It also included a lot of ignoring insecurities and putting pieces up regardless because you are trying to get over those struggles among your own art,\u201d said Aria King (VA \u201823) When asked about her favorite piece on display, Rosie said,  My proudest piece is the portrait series I did of my bestie Aria. We were asked to practice portraits from different angles in our anatomy drawing class, and we chose to draw each other! I spent a lot of time on these drawings and I\u2019m really proud of them. plus they actually look like her!\u201d For Aria, her favorite work revolved around the medium she chose to create it from.  I think my favorite piece that I put up was one of the portraits I did of Patti Smith just because I got better at using gouache through it and I just liked the way it turned out,\u201d she said. Since this exhibition is the last show these seniors will experience in their high school career, there is an abundance of emotions felt for this event.  This exhibition means the closing of a chapter for me. I was at the same school for eight years before coming here, so four years went by like nothing. I\u2019ve been able to learn so much about myself and about the world in the short time that I\u2019ve been here, and I\u2019m so lucky to have shared this journey with such amazing people. This is the first exhibition that I\u2019ve truly been proud of, both in the art that\u2019s up there and in what it symbolizes for me, and it\u2019s really an embodiment of the work we\u2019ve done together,\u201d said Rosie.  I think that what the exhibition meant to me was a celebration of the art that every senior has made and the fact that we have grown up, learned, and made mistakes, but we all have our own ways of expressing ourselves. It\u2019s a celebration of similarities and differences among our collective creative energies. \u201d said Aria.  After the exhibition ended, I just felt really bittersweet, things are ending and some of the people I have come to know over the last four years I will never see again. It\u2019s very much a feeling of joy that it took place, but also feeling how temporary it all is. It\u2019s a very sad and happy state to be in. \u201d One thing is for certain, that no matter where these seniors go in the future, their hard work and dedication deserves to be appreciated and celebrated. Some of their artwork is still on display in the entrance, so be sure to stop by! "},{id:83,url:"https://csartisan.org/AP-dual-enrollment/",title:"AP or Dual Enrollment? Which is better?",
body:"2023/05/19 - Every spring, students at CSArts debate on whether they\u2019ll take AP courses or Citrus College classes. For some, this debate goes on throughout the summer, and some hope for the best in the fall about their decision. But even after having put in so much thought, is one actually better than the other? On one hand, AP courses tend to have a higher demand of students interested rather than Citrus classes. This is due to the prestigious look of it on transcripts, as it shows that students were able to challenge themselves throughout their high school careers. Although even with such advantages, AP courses also have their downfalls; they demand a strong work ethic and resilience. Throughout the year, students are expected to prepare themselves for the final AP exam through countless homework assignments and lengthy tests. This can be hard for CSArts students to manage considering the extra work of conservatory many have to manage, as well as rehearsals and shows to prepare for. In addition, college credit for these courses is also not always guaranteed. According to the CSArts handbook, students will only receive credit after passing a two to three-hour-long exam. This is a huge deciding factor for most students, considering that if you fail the exam, then you may feel that it was all a huge waste of time and money, since the exams usually cost a certain fee in order to take the test. On the other hand, Citrus College courses differ between subjects depending on if it is popular during a certain year. The difficulty of these classes ranges depending on the subject. Overall, Citrus College courses can be considered to be the \u201ceasier\u201d option because of the automatic college credit granted if students pass the class, no matter what. These courses are also free of charge, and are a lot less anxiety-inducing when it comes to exams and credit. Dual enrollment courses, like AP classes, also offer a GPA boost for students. However, some students seem to dislike the structure of Citrus College classes, considering it isn\u2019t your typical high school class, and while it can be good practice for college, it can be a hard adjustment for some people. Grade formatting isn\u2019t the same as in regular classes, and student and teacher relationships can be hard to establish depending on the class. There are also many student complaints about the Canvas platform used in Citrus classes, due to the confusing structure of grade reports and assignments. Therefore, all aspects of AP courses and Citrus College courses should be taken under consideration before making a decision on which to take. As students prepare for the upcoming school year, it is also important to hear what their counselors have to say about AP and dual enrollment courses. Counselors will be able to help students take in both pros and cons of the two choices and support them in coming to the best decision.  For students already enrolled in an AP course, it makes sense for them to take the test at the end because you already work so hard the whole year. So, might as well take the exam and see if you can get college credit for it. Although if you are debating between taking an AP course in the fall or a CCC college course, it all depends on the student. Both can give you college credit but dual enrollment is automatic just by passing the class. For the AP courses, you have to pass the exam. So personally, I am biased, and I would lean towards the dual enrollment classes,\u201d said Ms. Shiroma, one of the counselors here at CSArts. Teachers who teach these college level courses are also a great source for more in depth information regarding the course, considering they are highly aware of student habits and common experience among the school population.  The fact that the college credit all comes down to one exam might be stressful for some students. On the other hand, having to focus on preparing for an exam might provide some students with a clearer vision of what they need to do in the class. Of course, both AP and CCC classes are going to have college level work expected\u2026 In terms of deciding, it is important to think about whether you want to focus on taking an exam or not. The AP exam is a multi-hour exam, and it will require extra preparation time outside of class. The CCC class doesn\u2019t have that type of all or nothing exam but it does have several writing assignments that are challenging. The courses are just different and one might work better for different students,\u201d said Mr. Pegan, who teaches the community college course for US history. School staff and students have very distinct perspectives on whether or not which course is better, and opinions vary based on your plans for the future and your current circumstances. Students who experience the courses firsthand have a more valuable take on how both courses can affect their academic or social life. Here is what some students had to say about their experiences in both courses:  The dual enrollment classes can sometimes have an exaggerated workload which can interfere with your personal life but in the end, I\u2019d say it is less harsh than AP courses\u201d  Alina Ayala (VA \u201825) Citrus classes tend to be less manageable and more professional, leading it to be more difficult. Although sometimes it can be the better route to go down because AP tests are expensive and it isn\u2019t as important when you\u2019re an underclassman\u201d  Kayla Rigo (IM \u201825) AP classes are decent as long as you keep up with the work. They also have very helpful benefits if you take advantage of them\u201d  Joann Cruz (VA \u201824) Emotionally AP classes are overwhelming to a degree, depending on the student. They have their advantages academically but it takes a lot of commitment. Depending on the subject I would take an AP class again\u201d  Maddalena Cano (VA \u201825)In the end, there is no \u201cperfect\u201d option for every individual. The demands of the classes differ and the factors that come into the decision-making such as testing, course work, and even what one wants in their high school experience. There are pros and cons to both sides, but the best choice is to go with what suits you the best. "},{id:84,url:"https://csartisan.org/the-shamrock-saint/",title:"The Shamrock Saint: History of Saint Patrick\u2019s Day",body:"2023/03/31 - On March 17th, CSArts students wore their best green clothes to celebrate Saint Patrick\u2019s Day. St. Patrick\u2019s Day is celebrated annually on March 17, which is the death anniversary of Saint Patrick. But who is Saint Patrick, and why do we celebrate him? Saint Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland and its national apostle. He was born in Roman Britain, and was then kidnapped and brought to Ireland as a slave at 16. He would later escape, but would later return to Ireland. He is often credited with bringing Christianity to its people. By the time of his death on March 17, 461, he had established monasteries, churches, and schools. There are a variety of myths and legends regarding Saint Patrick. One of the most notable is how he was the one to drive the snakes out of Ireland, or how he used the native shamrock of Ireland to explain the Holy Trinity. The traditions of Saint Patrick\u2019s Day have evolved over the centuries. The city of Chicago dyes its river green, and other cities hold parades, where thousands of people, Irish and non-Irish alike, gather together to celebrate the holiday. Corned beef and cabbage are associated with the holiday, and even beer is sometimes dyed green as well. Whether you believe in Irish luck or not, the holiday of Saint Patrick\u2019s Day is a fun way to celebrate the history, mythology, and culture of the Irish people.

This genre-bending film took home seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and several acting awards. Other successful movies were The Whale, which garnered two awards, one of which was for Brendon Fraser\u2019s acting comeback, and All Quiet on the Western Front, which won many technical awards. CSArts students reflected on the record-breaking night and who they wished had won. Rhys Shaw (ACT \u201823) was overjoyed with Everything Everywhere All at Once\u2019s win.  1,000% Everything Everywhere All at Once deserved to win. I think it\u2019s a very unconventional movie. And it tells a story in a way that we\u2019ve never seen before, that hasn\u2019t been told that has been needing to be told. It\u2019s been a great platform for much-needed Asian representation in mainstream media. It revived the career of Ke Huy Quan, who deserved it more than anybody else. It allowed Jamie Lee Curtis to go beyond the Halloween franchise and extend into what can be seen as more prestigious acting. And it cemented Michelle Yeoh as not only an Asian actress but also an important piece of American cinema,\u201d he said. Samantha Thomas (CW \u201824) loved seeing Sarah Polley win for her adapted screenplay of Women Talking, but wished it got more Oscar love.  It has incredibly powerful performances that got zero attention from Rooney Mara, Jessie Buckley, Claire Foy \u2014 and I think that it\u2019s a movie tackling such a difficult topic that typically in Hollywood is so exacerbated and exploitative. Also, the music was beautiful. The score heightens the experience of the movie and truly went out of its way to highlight the dread that these women feel, and I\u2019m sad that it did not get nominated for Best Original Score,\u201d she said. There was a sense of CSArts students being more passionate about movies this year, compared to last year. That was reflected in the ratings as well. Ratings jumped from last year\u2019s Oscars by 12% compared to last year\u2019s dismal ratings. Nearly 20 million people tuned in from everywhere, all at once, to celebrate cinema on the big screen.

With over 100 million users worldwide within a week of its launch, nearing numbers that rival sites like Google and Youtube, it can feel like nearly everyone is on the edge of their seats asking - What\u2019s next? To answer these concerns, we\u2019ve asked for an exclusive interview with ChatGPT itself. Here it is: ChatGPT: Hello, CSArtisan! I\u2019m happy to assist with your interview. Please feel free to ask me any questions you have. CSArtisan: With the immense rise in both educators and students using AI in school environments, a number of concerns have been raised about using AI to cheat. How would you respond to these types of concerns? ChatGPT: Concerns about using AI to cheat are understandable, but clear guidelines and policies can be put in place to prevent misuse of AI tools. Educators can make it clear to students that using AI to cheat is not acceptable, and students can be encouraged to use AI responsibly. AI can also be used to prevent cheating, such as through plagiarism detection software and AI-powered proctoring tools. Ultimately, it is up to everyone involved in the education system to ensure that AI is used in a responsible and ethical manner. CSArtisan: As both journalists and arts students at the CSArtisan, we understand the importance of human creativity. How do you respond to the idea of AI taking over both creative and practical jobs? ChatGPT: AI is unlikely to completely replace human creativity and practical skills, and is better used as a complement. AI can improve efficiency and productivity, but many tasks require human skills such as empathy, critical thinking, and problem-solving. A balance between AI and human workers can achieve greater results. CSArtisan: Thank you for your responses. Last question: What do you think about the idea of AI replacing search engines like Google and Bing? Do you think it\u2019ll lead to a slippery slope where AI replaces all technology? ChatGPT: While AI could potentially replace search engines, it is unlikely to lead to a total replacement of all technology by AI. However, the increasing use of AI raises important questions about its impact on society, including concerns about harmful or discriminatory use and its impact on employment. It is important to consider the benefits and risks of AI, and ensure its responsible and ethical development and use through regulation and ongoing discussions. CSArtisan: Thank you so much for your time. Could you please say goodbye to our readers in a fun way? ChatGPT: Of course, it was my pleasure to chat with you all! Keep up the great work at CSArtisan, and don\u2019t forget to sprinkle a little bit of creativity into everything you do. Stay curious, stay imaginative, and stay inspired! Goodbye for now!

March 8th was the opening night for the 10th Grade Showcase where sophomores showcased their pieces from last semester in the front lobby for everyone to enjoy! The show consisted of various types of artworks from a multitude of classes. The show included master copy paintings that sophomores completed in the 2D Design class. Students were able to display their knowledge and create their own rendition of other master painters. The show also contained a few pieces from other classes like photography and ceramics. Overall, the showcase was a great opportunity to celebrate their work in a space with their family and friends. Here is what a few Visual Arts students had to say about their experience with the show:  This was my first time being a part of a CSArts visual arts showcase! It was so much fun and exciting to have my artwork be appreciated by everyone. It was a great showcase and I am excited for next year!\u201d Alina Ayala (VA \u201825)  It was very inspiring to see my fellow peers use their skills to create something beautiful and new. \u201d Monze Aquino (IA \u201825)  My experience with the showcase was a bit nerve wracking because other people\u2019s paintings and photographs were really good. So, I felt a bit down because I thought mine wasn\u2019t good enough but then I realized that we are all different in our levels of artist and that mine was good because I worked hard. I could tell that everyone also worked hard and I think that is what counts as an artist and that is what is going to make other\u2019s experience the showcase\u201d Nayeli Gutierrez (VA \u201825). As always, the Visual Arts conservatory did a spectacular job, but this specific showcase was even more special. For the first time ever, visual arts students from the Exhibition and Design class worked behind the scenes to help the show come to life. From marketing, curating, decorating, and organizing, the visual arts students worked alongside each other to make the show possible. We asked a couple students who worked on the show about their experience.  It was definitely a great experience since I\u2019ve never created/designed a showcase before. It was challenging but my group was great and we had little trouble deciding the details. My favorite part of the showcase is definitely the center area where the ceramic pieces are shown! I also really loved the sign for the 10th grade showcase on the main wall!\u201d says the team\u2019s curator, Alisa Kang (VA \u201824).  Working on the showcase was really fun! It was a great experience to collaborate with a team and create that setup. My favorite part of the showcase was probably the centerpiece with the curtains. It was cool to put it up and really show off and frame those pieces,\u201d says the team\u2019s Director of Marketing, Dyllan Edge (VA \u201825)  Even though it took a lot of work and brainstorming, it was a lot of fun working on the showcase! We had to work from scratch, figuring out the theme we wanted, purchasing the items we needed, and contacting the teachers to collect artworks as well. We also had a deadline to meet, so it was even more pressuring. Although all the sweats and tears went into each individual tacky used to put up the paintings, the exhibition turned out wonderful! I learned how to work better as a team and problem-solve on the way, so the experience was worth it as well! My favorite part of the showcase was the main wall! My teammate created a beautiful font and I worked on laying out the paintings. I thought it turned out to be a very effortlessly perfect type of effect and I liked that a lot!\u201d says the team\u2019s client relations, Han Lam (VA \u201824) "},{id:88,url:"https://csartisan.org/the-history-of-valentines-day/",title:"The History of Valentines Day",body:"2023/02/27 - Between the kisses and candy hearts, Valentine\u2019s Day is a celebration of the patron saint of beekeepers, epilepsy, and of course, lovers. Valentine\u2019s Day is a commemoration of the bravery of a man who dedicated his life to nurturing and strengthening the love two people have for one another. The origin of Valentine\u2019s Day began in Rome during the reign of Emperor Claudius the Cruel. Under the Emperor\u2019s iron fist, Rome necessitated a powerful army. However, young soldiers were more focused on dedicating themselves to their families, leaving Emperor Claudius\u2019s military severely lacking. To combat the problem, Claudius decided to ban all marriages and engagements in Rome, catching the attention of a Roman priest by the name of Valentine. Valentine determined that forbidding rituals of love was a devious act, and retaliated against the Emperor in secret. The priest bravely continued to marry young lovers in spite of the Empire\u2019s decrees until he was caught in 270 CE. When Valentine was discovered, he was beaten and beheaded on February 14, becoming a martyr and saint within the Christian church. Valentine\u2019s martyrdom is a symbol of persisting and uplifting love in the face of all odds, and if not for his bravery and values, the candy hearts and chocolate roses would be a slice of imagination. Valentine\u2019s Day is not only a couples holiday, but rather a celebration of all love\u2014whether romantic, platonic, familial, or even artistic.

On February 4th, CSArts students gathered together to dance with their friends at Winter Formal, held at the Springfield Banquet Hall. The theme of the night was Enchanted Evening, and many dressed in their finest dresses and suits, some with florals, lace, and greens and purples to match the theme.  \u201cFor this year\u2019s winter formal theme, we wanted to go for a fantasy vibe, something that was really different from homecoming, Neon Nights. The venue had a whimsical feel and the potential to portray a fairytale scene. \u201d Jolene Young said, one of the members of the CSArts Leadership dance committee. During the dance, the venue was decorated with a variety of fairy lights, flowers and vines, helping to create a truly ethereal atmosphere to the event. However, despite the beautiful decorations, some were apprehensive of attending the event at first.  \u201cI was kind of worried about distance and finding people to spend time with, but that ended up not being a problem at all. I\u2019m glad I went!\u201d said Rosie Williams (VA \u201823) When asked about the process of choosing a venue, the dance committee said, \u201call venues are chosen prior to the school year by the leadership advisor. For these venues, the advisor looks at the venue capacity and having various spaces to accommodate all students. We also take into account the location, finding a place in the middle ground. \u201d No matter the distance or theme, all that were at Winter Formal can confirm that it was truly an enchanted evening to remember.

It\u2019s official: directed by Tim Burton and starring Jenna Ortega, Netflix\u2019s newest original series, \u201cWednesday,\u201d is a hit. Three weeks after its release, the show has already surpassed \u201cDahmer,\u201d for Netflix\u2019s second most popular English-language series of all time and has amassed a staggering billions\u2019 hours worth of views. A coming-of-age, murder-mystery, comedy with a supernatural twist, offers something for everyone to enjoy. However, Jenna Ortega\u2019s masterful portrayal of this protagonist\u2019s snappy comebacks, edgy personality, and dogged pursuit of the truth is what truly has fans obsessed. \u201cThe enduring appeal of characters like this \u2013 an admittedly toxic outcast with inherently good intentions \u2013 is the desire for every weirdo to feel seen on TV,\u201d writes critic Janelle Zara in How Netflix\u2019s Wednesday became a pop culture phenomenon.

As Wednesday navigates through this mystery and her new school, she is also tasked with the teenage task of repairing the damage she\u2019s done to her relationships. Tim Burton\u2019s \u201cWednesday,\u201d is undoubtedly one of the best series to premiere this year, and it is wholly deserving of that title.

This December, the holidays have consumed our campus with a wide array of different holiday food and desserts. The celebrations of the holidays include: Kwanzaa, Christmas, Hanukkah, Feast of Our Lady Guadalupe, Boxing Day, Omisoka, and New Years (plus many more). All of these holidays celebrate collective important themes of love, family and unity through the gift of culture, representation and food. Furthermore, eating a traditional dinner unites families through their historical and cultural foods. Food is a way to bring people together through cultures and old family recipes. The CSArtisan wants to share students\u2019 family recipes through this holiday season! Reina Sato, a 7th grader from CSARTS shared her favorite Japanese and Mexican traditional foods she enjoys this holiday season.  I love having mixed cultures. My mother is Mexican American and my father is Japanese American. Thanksgiving and Christmas are our favorite holidays. My favorite dish to eat at the Thanksgiving table is Takoraisu Mexican and Japanese fusion tacos. \u201d Takoraisu is prepared by combining tacos and rice to create a delicious marriage of two culinary favorites and end up with something so unique and delicious. Taco rice truly embodies fusion cuisine. What makes taco rice Japanese is that, aside from the Tex-Mex flavor, mirin, sake, and soy sauce are added. This gives it the extra flavor that makes Takoraisu even tastier. Sometimes it can be served with rice in a tortilla roll. Another variant of the dish is called \u201ctaco rice ball\u201d where all the usual ingredients like meat, rice, and cheese are combined, dipped in batter, deep fried then served with salsa or tomato ketchup. Reina Sato is only one of the many diverse students on this campus another student who shares multi-cultural heritage is Malik Brown, who shares his Nigerian-Dutch American fusion foods he shares with his family on christmas,  On Christmas my father makes kibbeling It\u2019s deep fried battered fish, sprinkled with spices and usually served with sauces, like garlic sauce. And if you like oily food with lots of meat and fish which is from the Dutch, too. \u201d Kibbling is an important family tradition for Malik, sharing that with his family brings him,  It brings me so much joy to sit around the dinner table and share these pepprey well seasoned treats with my siblings. \u201d Sharing these recipes shows the amazing diversity on campus, bringing inclusivity and joy around every dinner table.

They start their meal preparations early in the morning, before students even get to school. The kitchen staff prepares breakfast, snacks, and lunch each day. Asmik Yaghisjian, the kitchen manager, says she cooks breakfast with only the help of her assistant, Norma. Then, other kitchen staff arries, and they prepare for their busiest time of the day: lunchtime. Most of the food is made from scratch in the kitchen.  Some of them I create, others I just use recipes from my culture,\u201d Yaghisijian said. Just this week, when the temperatures got cold, the CSArts kitchen staff made homemade pozole!  This food is downright gourmet, and definitely better than any other school food I\u2019ve had. We are so lucky to have the wonderful cooks here at our school,\u201d said Mr. Turf. On the topic of recipes, what is the difference between staff and student food, is there even a difference?  I used to make a bunch of different food, but now it\u2019s almost all the same, we have the same salad bar and hot food. Only the Thanksgiving food is different. \u201d Yaghisijian says. She said she started the job of cafeteria manager because it allowed her to cook and work with the opportunity of a good amount of vacation days.

Endelman Secretly in The PnD Conservatory?: Look out for Dr. Endelman hiding in the shadows at your next CSArts performance! When asked which conservatory he would be in, Endelman says he\u2019s always been a PnD kid at heart. As a self appointed power-tool lover, he wishes he could learn more about set building, stage lighting, and sound systems. (Any PnD students want to take him up on the offer?) Dr. Endelman Before The Fame: Before his rise to fame as the CSArts principal, Endelman was just like the rest of us. He took bowling as a class in his high school and, after graduation, secured a job at his local Burger King, where he was voted, \u201cEmployee of the Month. \u201d What Does Endelman Do Off The Clock?: Despite working at an arts school, Dr. Endelman described one of his favorite hobbies as sports! He admires all aspects of the activity\u2013 playing, coaching, and watching. As a nature-lover, he loves being outdoors and can be found camping and hiking on the weekends. Dr. Endelman No Uvula??: Perhaps the most shocking portion of this whole interview, it was learned that Dr. Endelman has no uvula. As to why and how, we did not have the time in the interview to discuss. But, next time you pass him in the hall, feel free to press him a bit about this fun fact. And of course, be sure to have him say \u201cahhh\u201d so you can confirm this for yourself. What Makes The Endelman Wheels Turn?: On a more serious note, we also talked about Dr. Endelman\u2019s identity and what inspires his everyday life. Based on a recently-taken \u201cstrength-based\u201d assignment, Dr. Endelman describes himself as a coach, analyst, self-believer, catalyst, and Philomath (a lover of learning). He gets his inspiration from his students (woohoo!), family, mentors, music, learning, leadership, and coaching. Most Importantly, Is Dr. Endelman A Back, Side, or Stomach Sleeper?: To this question he answered with a simple sentence\u2013 no fluff, no nonsense\u2013 and I quote, \u201cI start on my back and end up on my side. \u201d Do with that information what you will, CSArts.

body:"2022/12/16 - Holidays are a time to celebrate with family, but for some, it can be miserable. In this divisive time of Covid, politics, and religion, spending time with relatives can be too difficult. As a result of this division, comes a new way of celebrating the holidays, with the idea of, \u201cfamily of choice. \u201d A family of choice can be anyone that you desire, as long as you feel comfortable and understood with those people. It can range from friends, coworkers, and neighbors. People who love you for your authentic self, and don\u2019t expect you to change when you are around them. The importance of a found family is the fact that it can be between anyone, whether bound by blood or not. Many people choose to celebrate the holidays with their families of choice, for a variety of reasons. Some merely find it easier to celebrate with those already living close to them, and find the trip back home tedious and far too time-consuming. Others find their families of choice more understanding than the family they are actually related to. There\u2019s less argument due to generational differences, and more understanding and compassion. The family of choice already accepts you for who you are, while some biological families may not, especially with older relatives.  Family of choice has been of great importance to the LGBTQ+ community. Many times, our queer siblings have been shut out or mistreated by family members. So, this idea has helped bring people together, who may have been shunned by family members,\u201d said Mr. Blair, a Creative Writing teacher here at CSArts. With the rise of mental-health awareness, families of choice only become more important. People would rather spend time with those who don\u2019t affect their mental health negatively, regardless of relation. It\u2019s hard to connect with those who won\u2019t connect with you, which many feel when being around their extended family. An intense family gathering is not the recipe for feeling good about the holidays, and can put a damper on what is meant to be a joyful time. However, with the gift of choice, holiday celebrations don\u2019t have to feel this way. There\u2019s no need for time with those you love to be weighed down by obligation and formality. Instead, people have the opportunity for new ways of celebrating, beginning new traditions on their own terms. Through a family of choice, people are allowed to make the holidays truly their own. The core of the holidays has always been to spend time with those you love, celebrating the love and care you give for each other. No matter who you spend the holidays with, it should always be with someone that will make you smile. "},{id:96,url:"https://csartisan.org/crazy-christmas-movie-conundrum/",title:"Crazy Christmas Movie Conundrum",body:"2022/12/16 - Now that December has rolled around the holiday season is in full swing. Which means people are busting out the decade old Christmas DVDs and settling down on their couch to watch iconic Christmas movies such as \u201cHome Alone\u201d or \u201cA Christmas Story\u201d. But then there are the more contraversial choices. Movies that walk a thin line between actual Christmas movies or movies that were just released during the holiday season. These movies spark the age old debate of what qualifies as a Christmas movie? Every month, student journalists at the CSArtisan get together and have a news meeting. We go over the news of the month, upcoming holidays, etc. all to figure out what\u2019s gonna be our next headlining stories for the next issue. When I brought up this story I got some quizzical looks about what this article would be about. But when I brought up Die Hard as an example of a \u201cChristmas Movie\u201d\u2026 The whole room erupted into argument! \u201cIt\u2019s not a Christmas movie!\u201d exclaimed our journalist M. J. , \u201cIt just happens to take place on Christmas Day the plot doesn\u2019t revolve around Christmas!\u201d Though the beginning of the movie centers around Bruce Willis going to L. A. for his kid\u2019s Christmas and getting roped up in his ex-wife\u2019s office Christmas party, once the terrorist plot starts up you completely forget the Christmas parts of the movie. Sidney, our graphic designer, had a different opinion, \u201cIt\u2019s a Christmas movie because the idea surrounding it is that it\u2019s set during Christmas so it should be regarded as a Christmas movie,\u201d And, as said previously, the plot does get kicked into motion by the terrorists hijacking the office Christmas party. Also, a lot of the trailers and promos about Die Hard really double down on the fact Die Hard is a Christmas movie I left the meeting feeling optimistic about this article. If even a throwaway mention of Die Hard sparked so much debate, I wondered what students thought of other infamous not-so-Christmas movies. So I set up a google form, to gauge what people classified as a Christmas movie. What I was expecting when sending out the Google form was maybe some lukewarm takes about Die Hard or the Nightmare Before Christmas. What I didn\u2019t expect was people saying HOME ALONE (technically) ISN\u2019T A CHRISTMAS MOVIE. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between a story set in Christmas and a Christmas story,\u201d says Alex the Christmas heretic,  Sure, movies like Home Alone take place during Christmas, and are the reason for events to happen, they are not part of the real story. Christmas stories are about Christmas itself, and the values we associate with the holidays like family connection, thoughtfulness and giving. Therefore, movies set during Christmas but with no message or story connecting to Christmas values doesn\u2019t fall under \u2018A Christmas Story\u2019 movie. \u201d Despite how controversal Alex\u2019s opinion is, I can see his point. Once the kid is left behind in house the Christmas aspect of the movie takes a backseat outside of Kevin\u2019s clever traps using Christmas items. But even with the Christmas themed trappings he was just using what he could find around the house! I\u2019d say the one thing against Alex\u2019s argument is that the plot is set in motion by the family Christmas trip to France. If the family wasn\u2019t going to France they probably would\u2019ve waited out the power outage and had a regular Christmas at home. The other thing I realized is how much this Home Alone argument echoed arguments about Die Hard. Both movies are centered around Christmas at the very beginning and the very end but the middle of the movie has next to nothing to do with Christmas! This is why I wanted to center an article around this topic. It so interesting to see people go into spirited fights over Christmas movies like they bet their life on this movie. It\u2019s also fun to fight over things they don\u2019t really matter! Especially with the world we live in nowadays.

Sometimes, that means switching conservatories. Dozens of CSArts students plan on transferring conservatories next Fall. This month, many students have prepared and submitted their transfer applications, and CSArts believes there is no shame in finding a better fit.  Generally, students switch conservatories because they have become immersed in the artistic culture of the school and have found other areas that interest them more,\u201d said Dr. Cook, the Dean of Arts. Students may also wish to advance in specific subjects, like ballet or painting, and choose their new conservatory accordingly.  The benefit for transferring to another conservatory would be to focus on another art form that has become a new artistic passion,\u201d said school counselor Mrs. Shiroma. CSArts students are surrounded by a wide variety of forms of art and opportunities every day.  I have friends in different conservatories. I think that gave me a perspective of what it would be like in another conservatory, and of the other possibilities at CSArts,\u201d said Sienna (IA \u201826). Those changing conservatories could also have experienced a change of interests. On the other hand, some wish to pursue their current or original interests.  My interests haven\u2019t really changed, but talking to other people, I\u2019ve realized that where I want to be is not where I am now,\u201d said Sienna. Some students, especially freshmen, are switching from Integrated Arts to other conservatories.  I think the classes in other conservatories are more leveled than the classes in IA,\u201d said an anonymous student.  In IA you start with beginner classes in lots of different subjects. \u201d Many see the Integrated Arts conservatory as a great opportunity to experience all that CSArts has to offer. Those transferring from IA choose the art form they connect with the most.  Visual Arts seems pretty cool,\u201d said Sophia, a freshman currently in Creative Writing.  I draw a lot during class to help me focus and pay attention to my teachers, so I should probably be in a drawing conservatory!\u201d Student applications were accepted until December 9th. Though the due date has passed, those wishing to change conservatories can still apply at the beginning of next school year.  Current CSArts-SGV students are welcome to apply for a conservatory transfer once per school year,\u201d said Mrs. Shiroma.  Current students wishing to apply to a new conservatory must submit a complete conservatory transfer application and participate in a new conservatory placement activity. \u201d High school is the perfect time to explore your interests.

But at this conference, there are no stoic business associates discussing forecasts and analyses. Instead, I see eclectic fashion, colorful glasses, big tote bags, and warm smiles. This, is the American Art Therapy Association\u2019s (AATA) annual conference. But what is art therapy? According to AATA, \u201cArt therapy is an integrative mental health and human services profession that enriches the lives of individuals, families, and communities through active artmaking, creative process, applied psychological theory, and human experience within a psychotherapeutic relationship. \u201d That\u2019s a lot, but it essentially means that art can heal everyone. Mid-November, I had the opportunity of attending AATA\u2019s 53rd annual conference in Minneapolis. As a student who attends an art high school, exploring different art careers alongside my peers can be challenging. I interviewed various successful art therapists at the conference asking what their journey was like to gain inspiration for not only myself, but for other interested creative minds. So, what are some of the paths towards art therapy? Professor Maria Riccardi who teaches at Concordia University in Canada said she was a curious and good student in high school.  I was Italian so I had a strict family, so I always had to have better grades and there was a lot of pressure\u2026 But yes I was art focused. I used to draw in everything I had, I took the art classes, and I started to really like it a lot. \u201d Professor Joyce Yip Green, an assistant professor at Loyola Marymount University\u2019s Department of Marital and Family Therapy/Art Therapy also shared what her high school experience was like. \u201cI was a nerd, a straight-A student. But I was also really involved in different clubs on campus like Key Club and Yearbook Staff. I was an art focused person so that\u2019s why I joined Yearbook Staff and the year I was the editor, our yearbook was nominated for best design. \u201d However, despite being passionate about the arts, Professor Green had no idea about the world of art therapy until she was in college, \u201cOne of my mentors told me that there was a master\u2019s degree in art therapy\u2026They encouraged me to go to grad school to study art therapy because I was a psychology and studio art major. \u201d Like Professor Green, Professor Lisa D. Hinz, director of the art therapy doctorate program at Dominican University of California, didn\u2019t discover art therapy in high school either. \u201cIn high school, I was an overachiever. I worked hard and I got straight A\u2019s. I discovered art therapy when I became a psychologist. I had a PhD in clinical psychology and my first job was at the counseling center. \u201d At the center, Professor Hinz gave college counseling and one day, volunteered to supervise an art therapy student. When observing the art therapy sessions, she was in awe of the process.  Everything I saw was so powerful. Because there\u2019s a visual record, it doesn\u2019t always have to involve so many words, and it was just - profound,\u201d said Professor Hinz. On the other hand, Amanda Power who specializes in children and adolescents, tells a different story of her high school years. \u201cI was kind of flying under the radar a little bit, school didn\u2019t come super easy to me, but I worked pretty hard. I had some good teachers who helped guide me along the way and that was super helpful. Definitely not straight-A\u2019s by any means but I managed to do okay,\u201d Ms. Power said. However, like the rest, she had never heard of art therapy until her later years in life. \u201cI was really confused about what I wanted to do after graduating high school and I ended up starting university\u2026 but I followed my passion to go back to art school. When I was there, I had an amazing art history teacher who talked about art therapy\u2026I thought it was such a cool idea because I always wanted to work in the arts and with people\u2026I was always trying to do some other thing and it always led me back to art therapy!\u201d Finally, out of everyone I interviewed, Megan VanMeter who uses art therapy for burnout treatment was the only individual who discovered art therapy in high school,  I was a very good student. I was motivated, took my grades seriously, and knew I was heading to college. People were telling me all my life to be an artist so I didn\u2019t want to be one. But when I was 13 I realized that I\u2019m going to have to choose something so I guess I\u2019ll do art. But I wasn\u2019t convinced. When I was 15, I took the PSAT and checked the box saying I was interested in art careers and I got emails from college programs mentioning art therapy. And it just clicked in my head!\u2026How wonderful to help people discover themselves through themselves. \u201d All of these people discovered art therapy in a serendipitous way. Through that one happen-chance, they all lept at the opportunity to help others heal through art. As Professor Hinz said, \u201cI think it shows that it\u2019s really powerful if you are a person who values art. \u201d With this knowledge, as students of CSArts, we can bring kindness and love to others through art.

Each group was given a dance studio to create an immersive theatrical experience inspired by Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s The Devil in the Belfry,\u201d said Mr. Blaylock. Jonas, a freshman, worked as one of five script writers and as a sound director for the shows.  It was a really fun experience\u2026 it was amazing to see what the actors and production and design crew put together based on our ideas,\u201d he said. The design and construction stretched over the span of three days.  The students began creating the shows on Friday evening with the performance on Sunday night,\u201d said Mr. Blaylock. On the weekend of the event, students planned, wrote, and rehearsed the shows. Though the students had limited time to prepare the event, they succeeded in creating four chilling Halloween stories. On October 23rd, CSArts presented four haunting shows in the dance studios.  I was really impressed with how much work they finished in two days, the sets especially. It was really entertaining! I was impressed by the cool use of music. One of them had someone actually playing the piano, another had a laugh track whenever they made a sit-com joke. One of them had a dance portion. I thought that was just awesome!\u201d said Jaya, a student who attended the haunted house. Tick or Treat was an all around eerie production that showcased the talent and creativity of CSArts students.  The shows were spooky and disturbing while maintaining a great balance of comedy and cleverness. The students really stepped up to the difficult task of creating compelling stories in 48 hours. And the audience seemed to really enjoy what they came up with!\u201d said Mr. Blaylock. Those who worked on the project agree.  It was really fun! I hope they do it again next year,\u201d said Sophia. Hopefully, CSArts will host another scarily successful haunted house next Halloween.

In case you missed it, the Musical Theater Conservatory put on an early fall production of The Drowsy Chaperone. The show opened with a charming old man playing a record that ushered in a heartfelt comedy, titled The Drowsy Chaperone, about a beautiful actress quitting the glitz and glamour of show business to marry the man of her dreams. Behind the red curtain and bright lights, the relationships between the actors and their characters set the stage for a successful run. Many of the actors took it upon themselves to research their characters thoroughly in their own ways. Sawyer Valin (MT \u201823), who played The Man in the Chair, even contacted the actor who played his role in the original production of the show, Bob Martin, to flesh out his character as much as possible. Jolie Wang (MT \u201823), who played Mrs. Tottendale, the bubbly socialite with an enthusiasm for weddings, watched different videos of her Drowsy character.  I built my version of Mrs. Tottendale out of [the videos]. I sort of pieced together bits of all the Mrs. Tottendales I watched,\u201d said Wang. Though the show\u2019s run at CSArts has come to an end, the cast of The Drowsy Chaperone will remember the family they formed and the lessons they learned through rehearsing, performing, and embracing the show.  You have so much more freedom and possibility as an actor when you are diligent with your character breakdown work, supportive of every member of your cast, production team, and crew, and consistently eager to learn about the show itself and the exciting process of putting on a show,\u201d Tara Moran (MT \u201823), who played Janet van de Graff, said. Students learned to dedicate themselves to their roles thoroughly and make the most of their rehearsal time to produce a masterful performance for everyone to enjoy. The Drowsy Chaperone was the semester\u2019s first performance, kicking off the new school year with comedy, music, and a reminder of what CSArts truly values: celebrating and honoring art as a community.

However, many left the theaters unimpressed. Twitter wars popped up all over the web with conflicting opinions on the film. After scrolling through countless comment sections, I decided it was time for me to settle this myself. Told through the eyes of a psychiatrist, who never recovered from her own past traumas, Dr. Rose Cotter starts experiencing a supernatural phenomenon she can\u2019t explain. This film\u2019s plot dealt with complex topics of mental health intertwined with the enthralling twists and turns of a modern horror film. Throughout the movie, the smiling faces do not lose their gut-wrenching horror and kept me on my toes. However, despite the thrilling jumpscares, certain aspects did fall a flat. The villain of the story was not outside of the ordinary horror genre and many agree that the ending felt a bit cliche and left much to be desired. This is not to say that I didn\u2019t enjoy it. With the chilling visuals and uneasy tension, this movie is a great way to scratch a horror film itch.

At CSArts makeup is exactly that, an art form. However, with the rise of assignments and homework, it has grown to be an afterthought, something that is much more optional. With that being said, it is still a prominent part of students\u2019 lives. Makeup, is also an outlet and an expression that crosses differen subcultures and factions becoming an ionic and recognizable feature. Sophomore Levvy Butler says makeup started out as a way for them to fit in. They say they lacked the technique and skill, but are getting more comfortable experimenting with different eyeliner shapes and colors.  So now, I wear makeup because I like the way it looks, and not because I want to look older or fit in or anything. \u201d Junior, Violet Zeug, says she wears makeup for a different reason. Makeup is less of a routine and more something she uses to improve how she feels. \u201cI guess it\u2019s some kind of insecurity, as far as feeling the need to be prettier/looking nicer/put together. \u201d For her, makeup is a tool, to improve her day and to make her feel prettier. Not only that, but it also goes with what she plans to wear. For example, when she wears her leather jacket, she\u2019ll wear thick eyeliner, but for a more laid back look, she uses thinner and much more breezy eyeliner. An anonymous student said that for her, makeup is both therapeutic and creative. \u201cIt allows me to vent, and paint my emotions on my face, whether that means large pigmented red and black eyeliner, or soft green, and blue eyeshadow. \u201dMakeup is a creative outlet for her, one that has taken a lot of practice. \u201cI find that there is no other form that allows me to be as creative and free as makeup does. \u201d Each student uses makeup with different goals in mind. For some it is artistry. For others, it is to fit in, or put on a protective mask. If you are interested in learning more about the world of makeup check out these artists!

It marks the day when the land of the living and dead merge. Sacrifices are made to deities and people put on costumes made out of animal skins.

Here at CSArts, Dia de los Muertos was celebrated by LUCHA, the Latinx Unidxs con Honor y Amistad Club. The club put up an ofrenda, an altar, in the cafeteria, as well as an \xe1rbol de vida (tree of life) outside. Students brought pictures of their loved ones, pets, flowers, and more to help decorate the ofrenda, and wrote the names of their loved ones on the \xe1rbol de vida. Dia de los Muertos, also known as the Day of the Dead, is a Latin holiday celebrated during the first two days of November. People gather together in homes, churches, and cemeteries to honor their deceased loved ones, bringing the dead\u2019s favorite foods, drinks, and other mementos to celebrate. Originating as an Aztec holiday, Dia de los Muertos used to be a celebration of Aztec goddess Mictecacihuatl. The celebration would last an entire month, where it embraced the inevitability of death rather than fearing it. At present day, Dia de los Muertos is celebrated by many Latin cultures, and food is at the heart of the celebrations. Some decorations commonly featured treats in these ofrendas, are sugar skulls, pan de muerto (bread of the dead), fruit, and drinks. Yellow flowers are also everywhere. Typically, the flowers are yellow marigolds also known as \u201cthe flower of the dead. \u201d They are used to communicate with the souls and illuminate their path in finding their way home through the petals.

body:"2022/11/15 - On Sunday, October 28th, CSArts students were challenged to create four immersive, bone-chilling, cross-conservatory haunted house experiences. Participants were separated into four separate groups and each given one of the Dance Studios to use as their set. They toiled tirelessly over the course of two days to generate an entire production completely from scratch\u2013 writing a script, building a set, designing costumes, and memorizing lines. I had the fortunate opportunity to attend this event, and I\u2019m sure even the staunchest critics can attest: every participants\u2019 efforts paid off in the most spectacularly scary way. The first room I entered was called \u201cBurning Hour. \u201d The audience arranged similar to a play; only we were all on the stage, rather than watching from the comfort of our seats. A well-dressed man muttering into his pocket watch walked us in, muttering, dragging his feet up the ramp. Inside, the scene began with a panicked warning made by a weeping woman, begging us to leave while we could. Then the scene shifted to pure horror. The Devil appeared standing above the woman\u2019s husband, \u201ctying\u201d him to a clock painted on the floor. The woman pleaded for mercy, but she did it in vain. The Devil killed him and laughed madly! The audience was then ushered out. I was really impressed with the actors in this room, more than anything. The actors had limited props and time to memorize their roles, yet managed to portray desperation, pain, and anguish in a way that was deeply horrifying and resonated with the audience. The second room we walked through was titled \u201cInitiation Institution. \u201d A group of white-masked cultists were searching for a new member amongst the audience. We were guided inside by a partially masked cultist and introduced to a room filled with white cloth-clad tables and chairs. They chose members in the audience to \u201ccompete,\u201d in the ritual, a game of (rather aggressive) musical chairs. Then, the winner was given a mask. At the end of the ritual, the audience member replaced the tour guide\u2019s seat. I was really amused by the way in which the cultists included the audience in this room, and the light touches of humor in the story. However, my favorite part of this room wasn\u2019t the participation, it was the piano. Throughout the narrative, one of the cultists played a huge grand piano, and I just found that fact so charming. It was really the coolest detail, one that really added another dimension of horror to the already creepy plot. The third room was called \u201cHome Is Where the Heart Is. \u201d We were welcomed into a large dining room by a loving family who was serving \u201csomething special\u201d for dinner. Throughout the meal, it became more and more apparent to the audience that they were eating a human heart. Admittedly, this room was my favorite. This room weaponized music and sound in a deeply unsettling way. They would play this laugh track every time a character made a joke, which sort of added to the horror of it all. At the end, they played \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again,\u201d which left the audience morbidly fascinated. It was truly a spectacular performance. The fourth room, \u201cOut of Tune,\u201d was another story that used music to frighten. The plot centered around a classroom filled with badly behaved students and their strict new teacher with an unrealistic set of rules. As the plot progresses the teacher revealed himself to be obsessed with uniformity, even demanding students to wear the same hair style at one point. However, as the students began to rebel, the teacher possessed them and forced them to dance, like puppets to a puppet master. I really loved the addition of dancing in this story. It added an entirely new dimension to the narrative and really completed it. I loved the look of it as well, this room had the most concrete set design, with a real whiteboard, desks, and even books all over the walls. I thought this was a nice touch. Overall, I thought that this year\u2019s eerie take on the haunted house was well worth the praise. I\u2019m anxious to see what terrifying torments our school has in store next year.

Covid messed up my highschool experience but now senior year has me suffering from another illness: senioritis. As my highschool years dawned on me, my excitement for college, my drive, and motivation suddenly fell. I was confused about who I was and who I was supposed to be. Losing myself, becoming lost in my own intrusive thoughts, quarantine created an escape for me and a lot of teens my age. I grew into a different person completely, as others matured and others stayed the same. But one thing we all had in common was we still felt like underclassmen; we still had time to make mistakes. Though when I look on my roster, we are all almost out of here. Now, as a senior, I find myself lost in the abyss of modern day high school. Going back to the beginning days in this school, CSArts San Gabriel Valley, I spoke with students who have been attending since 7th grade. They talked about their sadness in watching their classmates starting, and even harder, leaving. Their peers who have stayed at CSArts through the years have created a familial bond with each other, as they all watched each other grow and change through the traumatic events that came with the pandemic.  Even the bad memories and toxic friendships seemed to be missed, as once was recent, is now just childhood memories, seeing peers going in the wrong direction, or the right one, finds me stuck on where I have to go, I\u2019m glad to have friends I consider family at CSArts\u201d one student said. Some seniors are facing the problem of going in the \u201cwrong\u201d direction. As we see in schools and news reports across the country, students are acting out and learning hard lessons with situations they should have learned during late middle school and early high school. The pandemic has stripped students of these lessons. I feel this generation of seniors does not have the same maturity as the seniors before the pandemic. Why would they? Parts of life and experiences have been stripped from us; they have led some of my peers on difficult paths. I hope as time progresses we get the experiences that we lost in the pandemic.

This will give necessary space to expand the parking lot, and install more parking spaces. The goal for the needed changes is set for completion in the next 3 to 5 years. Last summer, the admin made new designations for student and teacher parking. Spots are numbered, and security has been tightened in order to make sure parking guidelines are being followed. Also, CSArts tried easing the parking pain by adding around 10 new spaces, but this still does not solve the bigger problem. It is not just a matter of too little space, it\u2019s also a matter of behavior behind the wheel.  There are behaviors and norms that people can do to make things less bad,\u201d Dr. Endelman says. He reports recurring problems with cars blocking the entrance to the lot, as well as cars parked in incorrect places.

McCurdy tells her story that most were unaware of and were left to assume. McCurdy\u2019s memoir is also filled with humor and finds light within the dark moments that she shares. She shares her experience as a child actress and the pressures that came with it. She also addresses the struggles she had with identity because the characters she played had become who people always saw her as. She gives the audience the insight on what she had gone through to get to the point she was able to write this book. This memoir doesn\u2019t only focus on her hardships but guides us through the journey she had to go through to heal from them. The title of this memoir may be off putting for some, but in my opinion perfectly encapsulated McCurdy\u2019s journey and relationship with her mother. I personally listened to the audiobook of this memoir, narrated by McCurdy herself and I think because of that, I enjoyed it significantly more. This book explores the toxic side of being a child actress in the early 2000\u2019s, and what she went through emotionally because of that. One thing that stood out to me was when McCurdy was the sole provider for her family at age ten. The pressure in the environments she was in all throughout her life up until her mother\u2019s death is written so unapologetically. From the outside looking in, the audience of her shows would\u2019ve never known, such as the dynamic between the cast and the \u201ccreator\u201d. There are so many instances where the theme of \u201cthere is more beneath the surface\u201d occurs. This memoir sheds a new light for many fans with what happened to her in the entertainment industry, but is also a story of grief.  Maybe it\u2019s because she didn\u2019t want to be a dancer growing up, she wanted to be an actress, and maybe Mom only sits in when I\u2019m being the thing she wanted to be. \u201d  Jennette McCurdy, \u201cI\u2019m Glad My Mom Died\u201dIf you or a loved one is experiencing or affected by a mental health, substance use, eating disorders or suicidal crisis, please call or text \u2018988\u2019 (or chat online on 988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline\u2019s website) for free, confidential, and immediate help. : "},{id:115,url:"https://csartisan.org/hispanic-heritage-month/",title:"Hispanic Heritage Month",body:"2022/10/13 - October and September are very significant times for the Hispanic community, as Hispanic Heritage Month begins.

Just as the class of \u201823 was readjusting to in-person classes, they were hit with another massive challenge: college applications. The stressors of school, Covid, and mental health are already challenging. Conversations regarding the absence of motivation circulate among the student body as tensions rise with the upcoming applications.  I feel that quarantine had a huge impact on my work ethic. Before the pandemic, I would always be on top of my work. But after, I feel like my motivation began to slip,\u201d senior Samantha Linares said. Junior year is usually known as the most academically challenging, but seniors say, the stress from senior year is even worse.  Honestly, I feel so unprepared. Junior year was doable but senior year brings on so much more stress due to college applications!\u201d senior, Emma Smith said. In addition to these issues of motivation and workload, some students feel like Covid interfered with important experiences that would add to their applications and their high school experiences.  I feel unprepared to write my college essays and because I haven\u2019t lived through enough high school, I feel,\u201d senior Tess Bellman said. The reality is, most high school students\u2019 careers have been spent behind a computer, and many feel that they do not have enough outside accomplishments to include in their essays and applications.

Horror Fiction students, taught by Mr. Meden, spend their time reading and writing frightening short stories, and discuss and analyze the works from the great horror writers at the beginning of each class. The Horror Fiction class is currently working on a character-focused short piece. Michael Myers, Freddy Kruger, Jason, and Leatherface are prime examples of character-pieces with troubling and demented pasts.  Oftentimes the best horror stories have a main character that is uniquely vulnerable or uniquely suited to the spooky situation they\u2019re in,\u201d Mr. Meden said.  So I\u2019m challenging students to try and write a story where their main character is the best possible character for their story. \u201d Many students are taking the piece head on, excited for the opportunity to let their nightmares get creative.  I\u2019m writing a story about a human-sized spider, from the spider\u2019s point of view,\u201d said Ethan Marvil (CW \u201823). Students are also excited for the upcoming content in the class as Halloween creeps closer.  People are more in the mood to write spooky stuff! And I think it\u2019d be fun if we did something for Halloween, like watch a spooky movie,\u201d Griffin Stenzel (CW \u201824) said. Though the class isn\u2019t diving into horror movies just yet, they have started reading bloody (literally) Halloween-themed short stories. So far, The October Game, by Ray Bradbury, is a class favorite. The short story follows partiers at a Halloween get-together playing a game of hot potato. The disturbing game does not reveal what\u2019s inside the foil. We\u2019ll just leave it to your imagination. But the class is not just about fun and fright. Mr. Meden uses these frightening stories as a way to introduce new skills to students.  I hope it was instructive to students on prepping a reveal in a narrative twist and how to get into the head of a really dark and horrifying character,\u201d Mr. Meden said. Mr. Meden and students plan on digging deeper into the history of horror, during the second half of the semester, as well as detach from the Western Horror Canon to explore more diverse fiction, like as Indigenous and East Asian Horror.

The first fire was in the 100\u2019s girls restroom, and was swiftly put out by a custodian. The resulting smoke of the first fire did not set off the fire alarms. The second fire, however, was set in the gender neutral restroom by the dance studio portables. This fire activated the alarms, and was put out by security. The school was safely evacuated during the conservatory, thanks to proper training of the CSArts staff. The Los Angeles County Fire Department arrived quickly to inspect the scenes of the incidents. Then, students were allowed to return to their normal operations and finish off their school day. At CSArts, student safety and security comes first, and CSArts administration is currently cooperating with the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department with an open arson investigation, as well as their own internal investigation into the incident.  There is currently no update other than the investigation is active and ongoing,\u201d CSArts admin said.

Teachers received an email from the CSArts administration, requiring seating charts for each class in order to track any new outbreaks and give more accurate information for those who may have been exposed to the virus. Earlier in September, President Joe Biden, in an interview with 60 Minutes, announced that the Covid pandemic was over. However, scientists, doctors, and some students at CSArts aren\u2019t so sure.  I don\u2019t think the pandemic is over because it is still affecting people. They are acting like it\u2019s over and that is what causes the cases to get worse,\u201d Senior Sofia Reyes said.  Covid is still a thing and there are still people who aren\u2019t vaccinated. I do not believe that covid will ever be over, but I believe that it will die down,\u201d Freshman Leaf Barnett said. Scientists urge caution in claiming that the Covid pandemic is over.  The pandemic is over. If you notice, no one\u2019s wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape. \u201d President Biden said. The White House responded that Biden meant to express the fact that vaccines have proved to be useful, and that the virus is now more controlled.

CCC",body:"2022/10/13 - CSArts students are getting a head start for college with two different options to earn college credit early. These two different avenues are Advanced Placement or \u201cAP classes\u201d and college classes on the CSArts campus from Citrus College, located in Glendora. But there are differences between the two options. The common avenue for credit is through AP classes. The Advanced Placement Course prepares students throughout the year to take the College Board Exams annually in May. Students pay to take the test for college credit. Exams are graded on a scale of 1-5. Most colleges will give credit for test scores of 3 and up. The positive aspect is that students can get a good grade in the class and fail the AP exam with no effect on the semester grade. Scores of 1 and 2 will not give you college credits, but do not affect grades on the transcripts.  I would say that the AP program does offer some advantages, especially for students not yet ready for the pace of an actual college class. A student does not have to take the AP exam in order to take an AP class and receive the letters AP on their transcript,\u201d Mr. Turf, a CSArts AP World teacher said. Citrus College classes, however, directly affect a college transcript for high school students. In partnership with Citrus College, CSArts is able to host full blown college classes on campus! This cuts the college board out of the equation entirely and allows grades in the class to count directly to college credit. These courses also allow teachers freedom to go further in depth on topics because they are not preparing students for a national test. This means they can adjust accordingly if students are falling behind. But it is important to remember that this is a college class. It is rigorous and students will be graded like college students. This means deadlines and assignments come a lot harder and faster than they do in regular high school classes. So, missing one assignment can mean playing catch up for the rest of the semester. Combine that with the different grading system, it can definitely cause anxiety for students. In recent years, there has been a push by students and faculty to phase out A. P. classes. With exams such as the SAT\u2019s no longer being required to apply to 4-year colleges and the $96 dollar price tag on the AP exams, students are gravitating towards Citrus College classes.  I am supportive of the moving away from A. P. classes because of the focus on the AP Exams,\u201d Mr. Pegan, instructor for Citrus College U. S. History, said.  Particularly in the social sciences I\u2019ve found that the A. P. Exams are not a perfect reflection of what a typical college level history class would have students complete. I also am mindful of the price associated with A. P. Exams. I think the push away from A. P. classes is driven both by a reflection on the value of courses for students and the role of an organization like the College Board in providing access to advanced courses. In addition, it is driven by fewer colleges accepting A. P. exam scores or placing more restrictions on their acceptance. \u201d CSArts may run into difficulty adding more Citrus College courses because the college requires more extensive education in order to instruct at the college level.  At CSArts-SGV, we have academic and conservatory staff that already hold a content-specific master\u2019s degree (or equivalency at the approval of Citrus College) that enables them to teach at the community college level. Having a content-specific master\u2019s degree is not common for educators working at the secondary level (high school). If CSArts-SGV were to entirely replace AP classes with Citrus College courses, then a teacher would have to at least have their master\u2019s degree in that subject, earn content equivalency by Citrus College, or operate the class run by a Citrus College professor,\u201d Mr. Turf said. The move towards getting college credit in high school is a popular goal; however, the road to get there is tough and grueling especially for secondary instructors. The goal in California is to provide students early and inexpensive college education as an investment into the state\u2019s future. If you have more questions regarding college credit, guidance counselors or the A. P/CC students on campus will have more information on the best route for you!

body:"2022/09/16 - As we dive into fall, the seniors of CSArts have a lot on their mind. College applications, scholarships, conservatory, and racing to be co-presidents of the class of 2023. We asked our new senior presidents about themselves and their feelings and plans for this coming school year: What inspires you and your leadership skills?: Bella Chang:  Being a good leader means putting yourself in uncomfortable positions where you can grow in confidence as a person and advocate for the people that you lead. I am always inspired by mentors and leaders I admire on campus, like Mr. Bowman and Ms. Kim. Tati Bovia:  I think our love for this school really motivates us to try and make it better! We want everyone to feel safe and happy in CSArts just like we have! Bella and I both love executing ideas and activities that help bring people together. Observing people and how they handle situations/looking at their wants and needs inspires me to be a better leader; learning how to calmly and kindly handle situations, disagreements, and as Bella said, being comfortable with being uncomfortable and being keen on problem solving. What are your main goals as class presidents?: Bella Chang:  Tati and I are beyond excited to make this senior year memorable for the Class of 2023, and that starts with unfailingly executing the plans/events we have set in place. Our main goals, outside of the traditional Senior Year activities, include \u201cMemory Lane Day,\u201d (bounce house, that rainbow parachute from P. E. with the handles, trampoline, etc. ), a Beach Bonfire day, drive-in movie night, and super awesome and wearable class merchandise. Tati Bovia:  Our goals are to have the best senior year ever! Something we have been super passionate about since we were class presidents our Junior year (2021-2022) was class bonding! Junior year was (almost) our full first year of high school and so we had almost a whole year of catching up and bonding to do. Bella and I love the Senior class as a whole and want to foster a healthy and happy environment for everyone to be good acquaintances! We plan on having multiple kinds of events people can attend (as Bella mentioned above), but we also really want to bring more acts of kindness around campus, like giving out flowers, leaving money in the vending machines for a random person and random notes of kindness! What do you bring to the table for CSArts that sets you apart from the rest?: Bella Chang:  Expertise and enthusiasm! We\u2019ve shown up and shown out for these past three years of high school; there is no team more committed and spirited than the two of us. Tati Bovia:  I think a genuine love for this school! I\u2019ve been at CSArts since it first opened, and it has been an amazing experience! Bella and I don\u2019t just think we are capable of doing all of the planning and tasks it takes to run senior year; we WANT to do it. Bella and I find joy in planning these events and find even greater joy in seeing people enjoy them. That is not to say that the other candidates don\u2019t love this school! Bella and I will do a lot for this school and will gladly sacrifice hours of our time and energy to make an amazing senior year happen. With a bright school year ahead, our senior class presidents are ensuring a variety of fun activities for our seniors to end their high school years on a high note.

Namika Conness and Riley Arce-Riolo are returning with a booming entrance into our school\u2019s plethora of talented young artists. Their popularity is booming and blooming as Forsythia makes a name for themselves on campus. They had a busy Summer, filled with bustling gigs and playing parties around LA. Forsythia is seeking to expand its horizons and gain the audience of countless readily available teenagers. CSArts has provided fertile soil for them to succeed in the music business. Their talents have enabled them to enter the LA music scene with an electrifying stage presence, leaving the audience asking for more. Members of Forsythia are grateful for the opportunity to express and grow in their art form here at CSArts. Their experiences here have helped them grow as musicians and performers.  My conservatory, Musical Theater, has helped me become much more comfortable with performing and speaking in front of a crowd. \u201d Riley said. The well-rounded education of academics and arts has taught the duo valuable lessons about performing in the real world.  My teachers have taught me that connections are very important. \u201d Namika said. Yet, there is still more to consider. The band\u2019s responses not only highlighted the skills that conservatory has provided them, they also resurfaced the annual struggle of time management as CSArts students.  Our school hours have definitely made it a lot more difficult to meet up and rehearse, especially since our drummer attends LACHSA and we have different school schedules. \u201d The band members said.  We have tried to rehearse on weekdays, but our longer school hours and far commutes to each other\u2019s houses have made it tricky. \u201d Time management issues are not uncommon on this campus. Each student struggles to manage their daily tasks, social events, school work, and extracurriculars. Regardless, Forsythia chose to focus on the positive.  Attending CSArts has definitely been beneficial for our growth as a band and as artists\u2026 I\u2019ve learned to have fun and just be in the moment because I\u2019m doing what I love to do: performing and making music. \u201d As the long days grow longer and as we submerge into the school year once again, it\u2019s important to stay positive and remember the privileges that come with being an arts student.  \u201c[We are] constantly surrounded by like-minded individuals with similar passions, drive, and creativity. \u201d Forsythia said.

New and returning students have likely noticed the colorful murals depicting diversity, creativity, and student life in an abstract form. One in particular showcases the evolving creativity of the Visual Arts Conservatory. Introduction to Style Writing, a Visual Arts class taught by one of the on-campus chemistry teachers, Mr. Mohamed, gives students a new medium and an unconventional canvas. Style Writing covers a non-traditional art form which is not typically taught in schools.  Students learn how to create with this medium in a safe, structured environment,\u201d Mr. Mohamed said. CSArts gives students the opportunity to learn and grow in a way they would be unlikely to elsewhere. Graffiti is a contemporary form of art, which originated in New York City in the 1970s. Mr. Mohamed credits the purpose of the class as a testament to the history of stylistic writing, in order to pass on the tradition of graffiti to a new generation. Graffiti is also most commonly found in locations with an abundantly diverse population. CSArts is lauded by many for its diversity and accepting culture, as it provides students of various backgrounds with equal platforms and opportunities to express themselves.  Students choose a name at the beginning of every year, something that is important to them,\u201d Mr. Mohamed said.  It could be a nickname or an alter ego. \u201d He went on to say that the students spend the semester creatively turning this chosen name into graffiti art. When Style Writing students aren\u2019t spending their time painting on walls, they watch documentaries on the history of style writing, work out new ideas in their sketchbooks, and critique the work of their peers, which helps them perfect their projects.  Every year at the end of the semester the whole class works on a collaborative mural together,\u201d said Mr. Mohamed.  My favorite would have to be from last year\u2019s class. \u201d The said mural was a massive stylistic writing of the words \u201cSPACED OUT\u201d with a green alien in a galactic background. It\u2019s painted over now, but come December, a new one will take its place. However, those past murals still exist, and will forever be a testimony to the history of the Visual Arts Conservatory, just behind the paint.

After reading, I agree with all the praise that this memoir has received. In Zauner\u2019s book, she explores her experiences with identity, family, grief, culture, and food. Crying in H Mart shares all of Michelle\u2019s struggles with being biracial from childhood when she would feel left out during Korean school to adulthood when she loses her mother, her connection to her Korean heritage.  Sobbing near the dry goods, asking myself, Am I even Korean anymore if there\u2019s no one left to call and ask which brand of seaweed we used to buy? Zauner not only shares about her Korean American experience but also shares about her journey to becoming a successful musician when everything was turning against her. She shares anecdotes throughout the memoir that would inspire any creative. The experiences and life lessons she learned doesn\u2019t only apply to Korean Americans, biracial people, children of immigrants, or creatives but applies to everyone through the ideas she shares about belonging, grieving, and dreaming. The stories Zauner shared evoked memories of my childhood and opened the idea that others have had similar experiences to me. Although I am not a biracial Korean American, some of the struggles Zauner had made me feel seen and I think many others would feel that way about her stories despite being Korean. Her stories of visiting South Korea reminded me of the time I first visited when I was in elementary school, making me long to visit. The vibrant descriptions of the food and sights she saw gave me wanderlust. If you weren\u2019t convinced to visit South Korea in the past, after reading this book you will for sure be looking for tickets to Seoul. The one thing that stood out to me the most about this memoir was the imagery all throughout making the reader feel like they were a side character in every experience. Michelle Zauner\u2019s memoir is a great start if you are wanting to start reading memoirs or want to learn more about the Korean American experience. It is definitely worth reading and deserves all the praise.  \u201cGwaenchanh-a, gwaenchanh-a,\u201d she said. It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay. Korean words so familiar, the gentle coo I\u2019d heard my whole life that assured me whatever ache was at hand would pass. Even as she was dying, my mother offered me solace, her instinct to nurture overwhelming any personal fear she might have felt but kept expertly hidden.

Winter Formal was held on February 5th, and tickets were already sold out days later as students excitedly prepared for the event. The theme for this year\u2019s formal was Old Hollywood. Old Hollywood, also known as Classic Hollywood, is a term used to describe the fashion, film, and overall glamour associated with American cinema from the 1930s to the late 1950s. Famous stars from this era would be actresses such as Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, and Judy Garland, as well as actors like Henry Fonda and Marlon Brando. Old Hollywood is legendary, setting trends for both fashion and film. The style of Old Hollywood is full of glitz and glam with an air of both sophistication and class. The women of Old Hollywood would don bright red lipstick and pearly white jewelry, complete with full-length gowns to shine and sparkle. As for the male fashion, sharp fitted suits and tuxedos paired with fedoras and ties were the go-tos for male stars. Their hair would also be stylized to be prim and proper, and most important, quite dapper all together. This year\u2019s Winter Formal isn\u2019t the first instance of taking inspiration from the past either. Earlier this year in October, CSArts had Homecoming, which was themed around the famous music festival Woodstock during the 1960s. The style of Woodstock is a definite contrast to Old Hollywood, involving far less glamour and looser, casual clothing. However, each of the styles have their unique charms to them and are overall staples of American fashion as a whole. It\u2019s safe to say that many at CSArts were ready to party with their friends at Winter Formal, regardless of how red-carpet ready they dressed. After all, Hollywood still remains a beacon of the arts, no matter how much its style evolves and changes.

It can affect anyone, but, statistically, it is more common for those in their 20’s and 30’s. The combination of weather changes, less sunshine, and the onslaught of homework can affect students, even here in “sunny” California.</p> <blockquote> <p>I just end up feeling really depressed and I find it really difficult to get any work done. Then I end up feeling guilty, because I am not being productive,”</p> </blockquote> <p>said an anonymous CSArts student.</p> <p>This is not an uncommon occurrence of SAD and the slew of work students have during this time of year.</p> <p>Although SAD is common, there are ways to help those who are affected by it. Doctors encourage those with seasonal depression to make sure they are getting exercise, outside, if the sun is shining. Sun provides us with Vitamin D as well. In the winter, it may be difficult to get enough vitamin D, so doctors suggest vitamin supplements. Wide spectrum lights simulate sunlight by using special light bulbs and can also make quite a difference. They can be found on Amazon. Most importantly, If you or anyone you know is struggling with SAD, you are not alone.</p> <p>Here are a few resources to help!</p> <ul> <li>Reach out to your teachers and counselors!</li> <li><a href="https://988lifeline.org">Suicide Hotline Number</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/">Crisis Text Line</a></li> </ul> </article> <div class="row mt-5"> <div class="col-md-10"> <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Written by Luna Martinez-Granilo </div> </div> <div id="comments" class="mt-5"> <div id="disqus_thread"> </div> <script type="text/javascript">var disqus_shortname="",disqus_developer=0;!function(){var e=document.createElement("script");e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.src=window.location.protocol+"//"+disqus_shortname+".disqus.com/embed.js",(document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0]||document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0]).appendChild(e)}();</script> <noscript> Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a> </noscript> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="alertbar"> <div class="container"> <div class="row prevnextlinks small font-weight-bold"> <div class="col-md-6 rightborder pl-0"> <a class="text-dark" href="/westminster-gardens/"> <img height="30px" class="mr-1" src="/./assets/images/posts/westminster-gardens.jpg"> Painting Pumpkin at the Westminster Gardens</a> </div> <div class="col-md-6 text-right pr-0"> <a class="text-dark" href="/art-therapy/"> Art Therapy <img height="30px" class="ml-1" src="/./assets/images/posts/art-therapy.jpeg"> </a> </div> </div> </div> </div> </main> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.6/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-wHAiFfRlMFy6i5SRaxvfOCifBUQy1xHdJ/yoi7FRNXMRBu5WHdZYu1hA6ZOblgut" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.2.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-B0UglyR+jN6CkvvICOB2joaf5I4l3gm9GU6Hc1og6Ls7i6U/mkkaduKaBhlAXv9k" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/theme.js"></script> <footer class="bg-white border-top p-3 text-muted small"> <div class="container"> <div class="row align-items-center justify-content-between"> <div> <span class="navbar-brand mr-2 mb-0"><strong>CSArtisan</strong></span> <span>Powered by the talented students of CSArts.</span> <span>Copyright © <script>document.write((new Date).getFullYear());</script>.</span> </div> <div> <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> </div> </div> </div> </footer> </body> </html>
