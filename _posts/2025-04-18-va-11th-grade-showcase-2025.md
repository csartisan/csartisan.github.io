Upon stepping into the CSArts lobby, you find yourself surrounded by various artworks of all different mediums; this is the 11th grade visual arts showcase. Straight ahead, there are projected animations, and all around you are pieces ranging from pottery, to fashion design, to photography. 

One visual artist included in the showcase, Peyton Mata, says, “I have learned many skills from experiencing the many different types of art VA offers to students.” 

The 11th grade showcase is unique, because in junior year visual arts students may pick the subjects they study. They have mastered the fundamentals, and now pursue what they are passionate about. This is reflected in the artworks, which were fueled by passion.

Peyton Mata showcased a photograph, and a 3D rendering of an environment that they designed. When Mata was prompted about their process, they explained all the hard work and, “multiple weeks and late nights at home,” that they put into the pieces. 

“I believe my art has grown immensely since freshman year. While I still have lots of room for improvement, I feel as though I have become much more skilled and gone from someone who was still learning the basics to being able to complete full projects,” Mata said.
