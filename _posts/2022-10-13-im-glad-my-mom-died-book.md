#### Trigger Warning: mentions of abuse and eating disorders

In Jeanette McCurdy’s new memoir, “I’m Glad My Mom Died,” she explores the rollercoaster of events that she experienced throughout her life. Most of us know McCurdy from the iconic Nickelodeon shows such as “Sam and Cat” and “iCarly.” McCurdy talks about how she had to try to grow from her childhood roles that she was forced into.

> I yearn to know the people I love deeply and intimately—without context, without boxes—and I yearn for them to know me that way, too.”

- Jennette McCurdy, “I'm Glad My Mom Died”

McCurdy’s memoir is a goodbye to her past struggles with various eating disorders, an abusive relationship with her mother, and her not-so-perfect child acting career. McCurdy tells her story that most were unaware of and were left to assume. McCurdy’s memoir is also filled with humor and finds light within the dark moments that she shares. She shares her experience as a child actress and the pressures that came with it. She also addresses the struggles she had with identity because the characters she played had become who people always saw her as. She gives the audience the insight on what she had gone through to get to the point she was able to write this book. This memoir doesn’t only focus on her hardships but guides us through the journey she had to go through to heal from them. 

The title of this memoir may be off putting for some, but in my opinion perfectly encapsulated McCurdy’s journey and relationship with her mother. I personally listened to the audiobook of this memoir, narrated by McCurdy herself and I think because of that, I enjoyed it significantly more. This book explores the toxic side of being a child actress in the early 2000’s, and what she went through emotionally because of that. One thing that stood out to me was when McCurdy was the sole provider for her family at age ten. The pressure in the environments she was in all throughout her life up until her mother’s death is written so unapologetically. From the outside looking in, the audience of her shows would’ve never known, such as the dynamic between the cast and the “creator”. There are so many instances where the theme of “there is more beneath the surface” occurs. This memoir sheds a new light for many fans with what happened to her in the entertainment industry, but is also a story of grief. 

> Maybe it’s because she didn’t want to be a dancer growing up, she wanted to be an actress, and maybe Mom only sits in when I’m being the thing she wanted to be.”
