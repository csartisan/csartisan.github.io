Once Upon A Mattress  hit the stage in February and received rave reviews. A musical of this magnitude requires the blood, sweat, and tears of more than  90 students and 10 conservatories. The Musical Theatre, Acting, Instrumental Music and Dance conservatories are all featured in the performance, but there are many other conservatories that play an essential part behind the scenes. The Visual Arts Conservatory designed artwork for the lobby, while the Production & Design Conservatory worked on sets and costumes. The Creative Writing conservatory also created fairy-tale-themed zines to hand out in the lobby and add to the buzz of show day. 

Before the performance, students go through an elaborate process. “Before we even get to opening night, students go through auditions, callbacks, rehearsals, vocal training, choreography sessions, and tech meetings,” says Chair of Theater, Jud Williford. The student leadership element of the performance is thorough as well. There are student choreographers and assistant directors who are guided by faculty throughout the process, allowing them to get hands-on experience through the entire production process. 

The All-School Musical is not only a performance, it teaches students collaboration and how to create a space with positive energy. It also allows students to challenge themselves to be a part of a larger cause. Overall, the All-School Musical showcases CSArts’ core values and how the talent of students with different creative focuses can come together to create one singular performance.
