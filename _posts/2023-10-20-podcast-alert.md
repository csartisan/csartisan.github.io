Loving the CSArtisan newspaper but getting sluggish eyes? No worries! The CSArtisan has a brand new podcast: “CSArtisan Talks!”  It’s our goal to give students a “literal” voice and serve the student body with the most accurate information through our podcast! You can find “[CSArtisan Talks](https://open.spotify.com/show/0HJcSdDT6CnREdafnh1Ilo)” on Spotify. Look for new episodes with each issue.

CSArtisan Talks gives students a chance to listen to the latest students news at CSArts San Gabriel Valley! Don’t have time to sit down and read the latest news? We’ve got you covered!  In the car, on the train, or while you’re out for a jog! 

> As the creator of the podcast, I wanted to take different external and internal factors into consideration. I was inspired by Mr. Blair, creative writing teacher and club manager of the CSArtisan, who taught about making all stories and reports applicable to everyone! And CSArts has the core valley of  excellence and equity for all, while fostering a nurturing environment of creativity, respect, and collaboration. I hope to exemplify this  idea of being inclusive and creating an audio version with a podcast is the perfect way to meet these goals.”

said Karina Yue, Producer and Host of “CSArtisan Talks”

> When I heard about the podcast, I loved it, such a great way for everyone to listen!” 

said Vana Kojikian, fellow writer of the CSArtisan.

> Honestly, listening instead of reading the newspaper is so much more enticing. I’ll definitely go check it out, and everyone else should too!”
