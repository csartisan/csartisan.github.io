As CSArts students begin their winter festivities, they try to keep the holiday spirit alive as teenagers, with decorations, festivities, and traditions new and old. 

The students at CSArts and highschool students in general are in a period of expedited growth as people. A common discussion among my peers is the nostalgia of our childhoods; this time of year, especially, we look back at the magic of the holidays as children. “The holidays feel less special and less exciting,” Vana Kojikian, a CSArts sophomore said, “I still look forward to it but it doesn’t always feel the same as it did when we were younger.” 

Students and teens as a whole scramble to keep the holiday spirit and magic alive. One way to accomplish this is creating the right atmosphere. A poll of CSArts students shows that over 50% decorate for the holidays the day after Thanksgiving. Another 16% of students decorate even earlier than that. Joy Thomas said, “I like to start decorating a week before Thanksgiving to have everything ready.” She explains that decorating earlier extends the season and allows you to make the most of this time of year.  

Childhood holiday traditions are still important to many teens, and help keep the spirit alive. “I watch movies with my family, cook dinners, and bake cookies,” CSArts student Sofia Wallach said, “I’ve done these traditions since childhood.” She said that, “Receiving gifts and waiting for Santa to come, are not the priority.” Wallach explains that now that she is older, instead of feeling holiday magic through literal magic, she focuses more on the spirit throughout the month, with all of her traditions. 

As we grow up, new traditions are formed to go along with the old ones. Wallach has a younger brother, and talks about her new traditions and trying to keep the magical element alive for him. She said, “I would help wrap his presents and try to keep him believing in Santa.” Students also spend more time with their friends around the holidays. Many participate in “Secret Santa’s,” or other winter activities like ice skating, gingerbread house making, and baking with friends. These new traditions can be just as important as the old ones.

The holidays feel different now that students are growing up, but the holiday season is still a magical time thanks to decorations, traditions, friends, and family.
