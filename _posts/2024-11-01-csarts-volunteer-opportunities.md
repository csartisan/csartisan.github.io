For CSArts students volunteering and community involvement are important on many different levels. Getting involved helps the community, increases students' morale and sense of purpose, and looks great on college applications. But how do you get involved? 

The National Honors Society (NHS) at CSArts has just kicked off, and with it comes a required number of service hours to fill. Social Sciences teacher Michael Turf is CSArts’ NHS organizer, and he poses the question, “How are you making an impact on your community?” 

Turf shares volunteer opportunities for students in NHS, including peer tutoring. He has posted fliers around campus for interested students, plus you can make a difference right here on campus. Service hours are convenient and available if you tutor students during office hours, rather than take time outside to complete service hours. Math is the most popular subject to tutor.

Turf also recommends that students check in with their conservatory directors for opportunities. They often have service projects connected to the conservatory. For example, The Dragon Kim Foundation has opportunities for volunteering with Instrumental Music. Visual arts also has outreach events with elementary school students. 

KEY Club is also an amazing club to join, as they help you get volunteer hours and are connected to a service based organization in Duarte. 

Turf said students do not need to be part of a club or organization to get involved in the community. He recommends that all students complete volunteer work, even if it isn’t required for school. “You’re starting to build your resume for colleges and career afterwards, and so how do you stand out vs other candidates?” 

And Ms. Christy and Ms. McMillen, two CSArts counselors agree. “Whether that's building your resume for college applications or future employment,” Christy said. The two also believe that volunteering is important because it encourages teens to work with their peers and adults, giving them real-life work experience. It can also expose students to new things and areas they don’t learn a lot about in their day to day life. 

Volunteer work is not only an amazing way to give back to our community, but it offers so much when building your resume, and amazingly, opportunities are all around  the community and here at school.
