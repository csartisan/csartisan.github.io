The Armenian Genocide Memorial Day is on April 24. It marks the day of the Armenian Genocide where 1.5 million lives were lost and is held annually to commemorate the victims. Although the Armenian genocide was in 1915, even today, the Armenian land, Artsakh is still being invaded and taken advantage of by its neighboring country. Due to the blockade by Azerbaijan, a humanitarian crisis, the Republic of Artsakh no longer exists. It is important to educate people about the genocide and these blockades so that history doesn't repeat itself. Students at CSArts who are interested in helping out, getting informed, and making a difference can go to [this link](https://anca.org/) to support. 1915 never again.
