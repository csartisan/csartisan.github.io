You may have seen some new faces on campus this week! CSArts-SGV has been hosting around two dozen exchange students from Japan. The 8th-12th grade Japanese students have been attending conservatory and academic classes as well as staying with host families during their time in California. The students will also be taking a day trip to Disneyland to conclude their visit. 

> We did this same program last year, and will probably continue it in the future. It's a great opportunity for our visiting Japanese students and for our students here.” 

Says Dr. Cook, the Associate Principal at CSArts-SGV. Japanese students stayed with host families from CSArts. If you’d like to host possible future groups of students keep an eye out for messages on StudentSquare.
