It’s a Bird!! It’s a Plane!! It’s a Woke!?

Superman ‘25 has been polarizing ever since the movie came out, with many praising the movie's message of kindness, while others feel it was another movie with an woke agenda. This made me wonder about the role of Superman in our society and why he’s become so divisive with so many people, so I've decided to use Superman ‘25 and its messaging to look into it. 

The birth of Superheroes as a concept came during the 1930s with Superman. It was a way for people to escape from the harsh living many had to go through during The Great Depression. When Superman apperaed on shelves of magazine stores. he brought hope with him. However, as time rolled on people began seeing him as boring and old-fashioned. 

I decided to have a conversation with Drew Lansford to hear his thoughts on the movie and he gave me a gold mine. When I asked about the political messaging of the movie, Drew said,

“I think a lot of people nowadays, especially with access to the Internet, are becoming a lot more radicalized and polarized, and that never manifests itself in a positive way, right? A lot of people generally are turning to hate more than anything else. And I think that a figure that’s unanimously popular, like Superman, needs to convey a message that is overwhelmingly positive.”

He then began criticizing some past depiction of Superman, especially from the Zack Snyder movies. Lansford said: 

“With Snyder, Superman was like an unkillable god who aurafarmed while people were dying and things were getting destroyed and things like that. And sure, it may have looked cool, but I think that from a hero like Superman, you want him to be good and kind and soft.” 

Drew’s perspective on Superman makes me think about the movie's portrayal of another iconic character, Lex Luthor. Luthor in the movie is a representation of ragebaiters, that manipulate people to cause outrage. He is such a good antagonist because he contrasts everything Superman stands for. The reason he loses in the end is because he underestimates Superman's capacity for goodness. 

"The one thing liberals and conservatives can finally agree on is that Lex Luthor sucks,” says Sean Gunn, Director James Gunn’s brother.  

Superman ’25 is a combination of things; a satirical look at the way the media has divided the country, another entry into the Superman franchise, and a look into the importance of a character that is good, kind, and soft.
