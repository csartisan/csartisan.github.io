You may have never heard of J.M Barrie, but you definitely know of his work! Barrie was a Scottish author and playwright best known for creating Peter Pan, in the play, “Peter Pan” or “The Boy Who Wouldn’t Grow Up.”  

The CSArts Creative Writing Conservatory offered a class to study Barrie’s writing for a semester. “Neverland” was the island where Peter Pan famously never wanted to grow up. The magic of Barrie’s writings turned into an opportunity to not only study his writings, but to bring other CSArts conservatories together to celebrate the magic of “Neverland.” Creative Writing, Visual Arts, Instrumental Music, Vocal Arts, and Production and Design conservatories collaborated to bring children and adults a magical experience through a “Neverland Experience.” 

Mr. Blaylock, the head of the Creative Writing Conservatory was the one who really pulled the entire event together. 

> There's this idea that everyone has their own Neverland, so it’s like every kid has their own Neverland, and it really just adds that magical element to it all. The Neverland exhibition proved that CSArts conservatories, when working together, can produce real magic!
