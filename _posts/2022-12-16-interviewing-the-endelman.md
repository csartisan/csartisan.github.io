Have you always wanted to know more about Dr. Endelman? Well
now you can! Members of CSArtisan recently interviewed the
campus’s most esteemed staff member in order to bring you the
inside scoop.

### Endelman Secretly in The PnD Conservatory?

Look out for Dr. Endelman hiding in the shadows at your next CSArts performance! When asked which conservatory he would be in, Endelman says he’s always been a PnD kid at heart. As a self appointed power-tool lover, he wishes he could learn more about set building, stage lighting, and sound systems. (Any PnD students want to take him up on the offer?)

### Dr. Endelman Before The Fame

Before his rise to fame as the CSArts principal, Endelman was just like the rest of us. He took bowling as a class in his high school and, after graduation, secured a job at his local Burger King, where he was voted, "Employee of the Month." 

### What Does Endelman Do Off The Clock?

Despite working at an arts school, Dr. Endelman described one of his favorite hobbies as sports! He admires all aspects of the activity– playing, coaching, and watching. As a nature-lover, he loves being outdoors and can be found camping and hiking on the weekends.

### Dr. Endelman No Uvula??

Perhaps the most shocking portion of this whole interview, it was learned that Dr. Endelman has no uvula. As to why and how, we did not have the time in the interview to discuss. But, next time you pass him in the hall, feel free to press him a bit about this fun fact. And of course, be sure to have him say “ahhh” so you can confirm this for yourself.

### What Makes The Endelman Wheels Turn?

On a more serious note, we also talked about Dr. Endelman’s identity and what inspires his everyday life. Based on a recently-taken “strength-based” assignment, Dr. Endelman describes himself as a coach, analyst, self-believer, catalyst, and Philomath (a lover of learning). He gets his inspiration from his students (woohoo!), family, mentors, music, learning, leadership, and coaching.

### Most Importantly, Is Dr. Endelman A Back, Side, or Stomach Sleeper?

To this question he answered with a simple sentence– no fluff, no nonsense– and I quote, “I start on my back and end up on my side.” Do with that information what you will, CSArts.

In all seriousness, thank you Dr. Endelman for your participation in this interview. And thank you, reader, for taking the time to learn a little bit more about your principal.
