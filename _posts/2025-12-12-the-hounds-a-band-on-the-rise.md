Music is like the backbone of CSArts; it's the one thing that most conservatories have in common. Independent bands are pretty popular, especially amongst the students in the music conservatory. However, amongst many other bands, a band called The Hounds has been making a significant impression on the scene. Formed in late May, The Hounds is a band consisting of CSArts students, Winston Rabon, Ethan Mattern, Edward Jones, and Otis VerGow. Before The Hounds, Winston and Edward were previously in a band called Driftwood. Upon deciding they no longer wanted to be a cover band, they decided to form their own.

The Hounds are "more than just a band," Winston said they're "also really close friends." Each member said that their favorite part of being in the band was the bond they all shared, "[it's] just being able to make music with my friends," said Edward. Although previously carrying a friendship, being part of The Hounds brought them much closer together. The friendship they have makes it easier to split responsibilities evenly.

All members of the band contribute to lyric writing, and bassist Otis said he intends to "write songs that are similar to the way the Grateful Dead tell stories." Each member has their own inspirations and means for pursuing music. As the lead singer, Edward is inspired by Elton John, Frank Sinatra, and David Bowie who all share a similarity in powerful vocals to him. Ethan, the drummer of The Hounds, gets his inspiration from the Canadian drummer, Larnell Lewis. The Hounds doesn't fall under a specific genre, but Winston the lead guitarist claims to be inspired by funk, blues, and psychedelic rock. Although their music doesn't have a singular genre to describe it, "it's definitely in the rock spectrum" as said by Winston.

A band is far more work than just playing music, they also need to organize rehearsals, shows, social media, and resolve conflicts. Ethan takes the role of peacemaker in the band, "when there's disagreements I try to be diplomatic and keep everyone together," he said. Otis said he shines most in, "making sure everybody is on the same page and is heard evenly." On the other hand, Edward is the communicator for people outside of the band such as venue owners. The organizer of the band is Winston who schedules rehearsals and runs The Hounds' official Instagram account.

Despite the nuances that come with committing to a band, the hard work of The Hounds pays off. Each member earns about $110 after their house shows (which are often in Winston's backyard), and about $60 at venue shows due to other expenses. With the money they earn they continue to put it towards their passion, "I reinvest earnings into the band whether that's new strings for my bass or travel expenses," said Otis. One of the biggest expenses that The Hounds had to make was paying for studio time, but after the lead singer of the band Candlebox attended one of their shows, he offered them an opportunity to record in a professional studio for free.

The Hounds can be found performing at Lucky Strike in Hollywood every month because they have a residency at their venue. However, if live music isn't your cup of tea, they have an album to be released early 2026. The recording of the album is still in progress and is being polished so there hasn't been a title yet confirmed. The album currently consists of 8 full tracks of original songs, but it has a goal of 12. "I want it to be something that inspires you to create something yourself," said Winston, "something that makes you feel understood in a way."

The Hounds has really proved itself as a band since it began and they will continue to do so. For information about shows and other news be sure to follow @thehoundsofficial on Instagram. Support your fellow students and their hard work by attending their shows and streaming their albums.
