There is a major shortage of blood in the U.S. according to The American Red Cross, and CSArts students and faculty rolled up their sleeves to give the gift of life to two different blood drives.  

Students also had the opportunity to help with registration, event scheduling, public outreach, and clean-up and earned volunteer hours for their hard work.

Over 70 donors rolled up their sleeves and donated 73 pints of blood. This amount could save as many as 220 lives!  

> Partnering with the Red Cross to host a blood drive at CSArts has been extremely important to me as I am able to directly connect students to the opportunity of helping those in need. I strive to create a positive environment so students and community members continue to help in any way possible,” 

sophomore Makenna Bear said.

CSArts-SGV also collaborated with Duarte High School’s Interact Club to host a blood drive with City of Hope in order to further their impact.

Approximately 65 donors made up of staff and students donated in this separate event and students understand by donating, they can make a difference and save lives.  

> Hosting a blood drive is essential to the community right now. Everything we can do to help patients and families, especially within our local community is crucial. I hope this inspires others to also lend a hand and make a difference in the world,“ 

sophomore Natalie Lanza, president of the Rotary Club, said. 

If you would like to donate, you must be at least 16 years of age, weigh a minimum of 110 pounds, and be free of serious medical conditions. If you’re interested in donating, you can make an appointment to give blood or platelets by contacting the Red Cross at 1 800 RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767) or City of Hope at [idonateblood4hope.org](https://www.idonateblood4hope.org).
