Remember seeing a lot of purple on campus a few weeks ago? Students from Tsinghua University High School in China wore uniforms in this color when visiting CSArts at the beginning of February.  

Tsinghua University High School is one of the top schools in Beijing. An agency had recommended that the students visit CSArts because of its high college admission rates. While on the CSArts campus, they attended academic classes but left before conservatory started.

The Tsinghua students aimed to practice their English by being in English-speaking classrooms, but they also helped CSArts students learn too. In the Mandarin classroom, they participated in discussions with the CSArts students of higher levels and played games with the students of lower levels. Mandarin teacher, Ms. Yang, also had them introduce themselves to the class. 

“My students get good listening practice when they tell them what they like to do, what their names are, stuff like that.”

Ren Yilin, a student from Tsinghua University High School, said CSArts was the first American school he has visited. When asked what differences he observed, he said that his school focused on memorizing facts, while CSArts emphasized active thinking, 

“But about the students here,” Yilin said, “I think we’re all the same. We are all accepting, care for others, and are all warmhearted.”
