CSArts students' schedules are packed, and so are their bags. The lack of lockers rests on the shoulders of the student body. There are about 150 lockers and 1,200 students, and CSArts Admin is not planning on adding more in the near future.

> We have actually found that students at CSArts-SGV have less need for lockers than students at more comprehensive high schools. We tend to issue fewer textbooks and utilize more digital resources.‚Äù 

said assistant principal Abbe Levine.

Most of the locker storage is given to students in the Dance and Instrumental Music Conservatories.  

School leaders say that if students have the need for extra storage space, they should contact their conservatory director to support those needs.
