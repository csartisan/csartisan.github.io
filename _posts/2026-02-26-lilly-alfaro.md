How do I remember Lilly? That’s the question that has been ruminating in my mind for the last few weeks without much warning and with my resistance. This is what I have so far: I was sitting in the back of Mr. Skinner's economy class, my mind wandering off, when a girl during some free time, asked me for the three playing cards on my table. I gave them to her and saw she was building her own house of cards. A few days later, I sat with her as she continued construction of her card castle. I did not pay much attention, but I did notice her kind smile and focused eyes, communicating to me she was enjoying herself. And maybe I would have asked why she was building it, or anything at all, if I would have known this would be my last moment with Lilly. 

Lilly Alfaro was a member of our school community, so it is important that we take time to remember her, learn from her life, and honor her in every way. Each mural and event we have had is furthering our appreciation and respect for her.  So for this article about Lilly, I wanted to ask the community about her. 

“She was always real jovial,” said Mr. Louis Gutierrez, who had Lilly as a TA for two years. “She had a great sense of humor, and sometimes, you know, I was the butt of the joke. I would say something like, ‘Oh, that song’s rad’ and she’d be like, ‘Mr. G, you’re not supposed to talk that way.’” Mr. G has many heartwarming memories. “I have so many stories about her, but all the stories are the same, man, just makes you smile, makes your heart happy, and she did a great job of making people that she interacts with feel very, very special.” 

CSArts-SGV Principal of Academics Ms.Nicole Read had warm words and memories as well.   “Lilly has left a memory of a student who always had a smile and was really sweet. She was always kind to me and radiated joyful energy. Her loss has impressed upon me how fleeting life is and reminds me to hold my loved ones precious and to tell them I love them more.” 

Ms. Read also spoke about the process of providing student support in the days following. “We brought crisis response teams on campus that first week and our school counselors, school psychs, Wellness Center folks, and our Restorative Practices Specialist have continued meeting with students regularly as they manage grief. Part of that process was planning the ‘Heart Event’  on the field Friday, February 6th. We wanted to create a moment for students and Lilly's sisters to honor her collectively. The sisters suggested a wear purple day and I think in total, that was a great way for people to comfort each other and show support. The family's gofundme is still active and that is a way for folks to continue showing their support. And live better. This tragic incident reminds us of the value of friendship and time.”

I hope to anyone grieving, that this article serves to celebrate Lilly’s life and will be a keepsake so that students can keep her spirit alive in the future. 

Rest in peace, Lilly.
