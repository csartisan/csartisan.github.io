On March 15th, I watched John Proctor is the Villain, and it's not an overstatement to say it blew me away. The whole production had a sense of realism unlike any other show I’ve seen this year. It felt less like I was watching the show and more like I was peering through the window of the character’s actual life. Some moments felt so intimate that I shouldn’t have watched them unfold. 

The main star of the show for me was the acting. All the people in the play put on a tour-de-force of emotional range. The show itself handles very complex and heavy themes like relationships, sexual assault, and feminism in an impactful way, and the actors played it so naturally that I found myself gripped by the drama happening in front of me. 

The set design also played an integral role in grounding the story. The classroom setting was seamless and added to the feeling that this was happening to people I’d known my entire life, so props to P&D.

I think the most impressive part of the whole project was that it was done in the first place. I admire the fact that our school was willing to put on a show that tackled these heavy subject matters and did not shy away from them. 

John Proctor is the Villain is one of the best shows I’ve seen this school put on and I’m excited to see what comes next.
