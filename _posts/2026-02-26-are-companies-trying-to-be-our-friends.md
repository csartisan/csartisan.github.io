Scroll through social media for a few minutes and you might notice something interesting: brands joking in comment sections, reposting videos about hot social issues, and marketing using informal language and internet humor. Large corporations are increasingly trying to present themselves as friends—relatable, funny, and human. While some consumers see these actions as harmless, others argue they deserve more scrutiny.

From a business perspective, this strategy makes sense. Social media has changed how people interact with brands. Instead of distant advertisements, companies share platforms with everyday users. By engaging in comment sections or responding directly to customers, brands can feel accessible rather than corporate and cold.

Supporters of this approach argue that there is nothing inherently wrong with it. They believe friendly branding simply reflects how communication has evolved online. It also makes information easier to understand. Additionally, many companies use friendly marketing to highlight positive efforts, such as sustainability initiatives or charitable donations. 

Critics argue that corporate friendliness can be misleading. Unlike a friend, a company’s primary goal is profit. The difference in motivation means that casual language does not reflect genuine care for consumers. Friendly marketing can easily mask harmful practices like worker exploitation and environmental damage. It can also be incredibly influential on younger consumers who may not yet have the media literacy skills to recognize marketing tactics. 

Many brands also struggle to be truly relatable. Some deliberately blur the line between brand and friend, feeding the “we’re just like you” narrative despite having vastly more money, power, and influence than individual consumers.

In recent years, it has become more common for people to buy products like makeup or clothing based largely on brand identity rather than necessity or quality alone. Overall, simply being aware of these tactics can allow consumers to make informed choices and enjoy creative marketing.
