As the first flowers of Spring start to bloom and we continue deeper into the school year, students are experiencing more burnout than ever. So how do we avoid it, and if we’ve caught it, how do we let it go? 

Numerous CSArts students say that despite the fact that it’s only February, burnout has hit an epidemic level. Sophomores Sofia Wallach and Vana Kojikian describe themselves as, “tired and unmotivated,” and not sure how to get focused again.

CSArts counselor Mindy Shiroma advises students to, “set realistic goals, prioritize self-care, take breaks, maintain a healthy sleep schedule, and seek support.” Shiroma invites students to ask themselves:  “What might be out of balance?”

Burnout does not often come from school work alone. Students often overexert themselves in all areas of their lives. Ms. Shiroma advises students to pause and self-reflect on priorities (such as sleep, relationships, and down time). She goes on to emphasize the importance of reaching out, “If you need help academically, please visit teachers during Office Hours to assist you with creating a ‘To-Do’ list to help you get back on track.”

Juniors dealing with college applications may have heightened feelings of fatigue and lack of motivation. Counselors are currently meeting with all Juniors for their Junior -Year -College- Counseling Meeting to discuss the college application timeline and process. This is an amazing opportunity for these students to reach out about any intensified feelings of burnout and how to deal with it on a personal level. 

Ms. Shiroma encourages students, saying, “Keep doing your best work!” Sometimes burnout is inevitable, but students can lessen the effects by reflecting and balancing their schoolwork with sleep and activities that bring them joy.
