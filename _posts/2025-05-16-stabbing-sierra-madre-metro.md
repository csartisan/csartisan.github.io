A stabbing at the Sierra Madre Villa Station in April has left metro-riders shocked and unsettled. It happened on the morning of April 17th. The victimâ€™s name and condition has not been released; however, they were transported to the hospital with multiple stab wounds. 

The Los Angeles Sheriff's department says it has arrested one person, Antonio Olivera, who remains in custody. 

According to investigators, the suspect was wearing a security guard uniform, although authorities confirmed that he was not employed by metro. Police say the attack happened on the pedestrian bridge to the train platform. It was shut down for the investigation.

CSArts Senior Abigail Risdon said she arrived at the station that morning to take the train, but was quickly told to back away from the scene. She thought it was just normal police activity, but she wasn't able to cross the bridge. Risdon was then taken to the next station by her aunt because there was no form of shuttling provided. 

Olivera now faces one felony count each of assault with a deadly weapon and assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury. A future preliminary hearing will be scheduled to determine if there is sufficient enough evidence for the case to then proceed to trial.
