As the end of the year approaches with state testing in the rearview mirror, one test remains for freshmen that stands out from the others: The California Physical Fitness Test.

### What is the California Physical Fitness Test?

According to the California Department of Education, the Physical Fitness Test (or PFT) all ninth graders are required to take the test which contains five components: Aerobic Capacity, Abdominal Strength, Trunk Extensor Strength, Upper Body Strength, and Flexibility.

Each of these components comes with its own methods for testing. For Aerobic Capacity, there's either the one-mile run, 20-meter Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run (also known as the PACER), or the walk test. For Abdominal Strength, students will perform curl-ups, where “students lie on their back with their knees bent at a 140° angle, feet flat on the mat, and their hands at their sides, palms down. Moving slowly, students curl up, sliding their fingers across a measuring strip on the mat, and then curl back down until their head touches the mat.” For Trunk Extensor Strength, students will perform trunk lifts, where “While lying face down on a flat surface, students are asked to slowly lift their upper body off the floor, using the muscles of the back, to a maximum of 12 inches. Students need to hold the position for measurement.” For Upper Body Strength, students will perform push-ups. Then finally, for Flexibility, students will perform Bac-Saver Sit and Reach. “Starting in a sitting position, with the left leg extended (the foot is flat against the front side of the box needed for this test) and the right leg bent, the student reaches forward with both hands along the scale printed on the box. The same procedure is repeated with swapping legs to measure reach distance with the other side of the body.” Just reading this is painful for many.

### How do you pass the PFT?

To pass the PFT, the student has to be in the “Healthy Fitness Zone” for each of the exercises. Each of these is calculated through a specific equation and being in the HFZ is also determined by factors like gender, height, and weight, as all of these are measured and kept to different standards.

### Why do students have to take the PFT?

The PFT is a resource our school can use to monitor the overall health and fitness of its students and is also helpful in monitoring the effectiveness of our physical education programs. 

### Should freshmen be worried about the PFT?
 
No. Over the years the test has been changed to accommodate a variety of student needs and doing poorly on the PFT is not reflected in your transcript.
