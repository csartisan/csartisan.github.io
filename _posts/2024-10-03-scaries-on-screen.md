One of the highlights of Halloween is watching frightening films! We had CSArts students take a poll of their favorite fun Halloween movies and their favorite horror movies. 
	
In the fun and less frightening category, the top three movies were:
- Corpse Bride with 50% of the vote.
- Hocus Pocus with 25%. And
- The original Beetlejuice at 15% 
- The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline were honorable mentions

> Corpse Bride is my favorite Halloween/Fall movie, because, in my opinion, it’s the best movie to curl up on the couch and watch, especially if it’s cold and dark outside!” 

says Nico Deany, a 10th grader here at CSArts.

The top Horror films according to The CSArtisan poll were:
- The Conjuring with the majority of the votes and 
- Scream, It, and Megan evenly split.
	
> I loved the cinematography and the eerie atmosphere in The Conjuring!” 

says Joy Thomas, a 10th grader here at CSArts. 

If you’re looking for fresh frightful films, Steven King’s Salem’s Lot new adaptation is available on MAX. *Terrifier 3* opens in theaters on October 11th, and *Smile 2* hits theaters on October 18th. The final season of *What We Do In The Shadows* premieres on FX October 21st.
