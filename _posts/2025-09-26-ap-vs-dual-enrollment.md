At the beginning of each school year, students must ask themselves one question, “Are the classes I’m taking worth it?” The question isn’t a simple one to answer. Mental strain, time spent and money are all a part of the equation. 

It is never recommended to overload yourself with rigorous courses. The challenge for students is getting the right balance between building an impressive transcript and maintaining strong grades. For some, this means taking multiple AP classes at once. For many students looking to bulk up their transcript, AP classes are an appealing option. They demonstrate academic rigor and prepare students for college-level work, but it may also come at the cost of late nights, stress, and burnout. And while passing the course itself is an achievement, students must also score well on the AP exam which costs nearly $100 per test in order to earn college credit. “AP is more of a gamble and it's not always worth it. With CCC classes I know I am going to get a pay off for the work I’ve done,” said Creative Writing senior Natalie Lanza. 

Dual Enrollment has become an increasingly popular alternative to AP. These courses allow students to take college-level classes, often for free, and earn credit simply by passing the class. Without the added pressure of a test at the end of the course, dual enrollment can feel more accessible. Still, these courses are not without their challenges. They demand responsibility, maturity, and the ability to adapt to a college classroom environment while still in high school.

Both AP and dual enrollment offer clear advantages, but they also come with challenges. Neither option is universally better. The right choice depends on the student’s goals, learning style, and ability to balance workload with other responsibilities. In the end, the most important consideration is not just how impressive a transcript looks, but whether the courses chosen support both academic success and personal well being.
