The transition from junior to senior year is one of the most important, and demanding, parts of high school. With a packed schedule during the school year from homework, conservatory classes, and extracurricular activities, many students see the summer as an opportunity to relax. However, according to your CSArts counselors, it is also a great time to prepare for what’s ahead. The CSArtsian has created a list of next steps to help incoming seniors out.

### Get Ahead on College Applications
The Common App and UC Application open on August 1st. Begin drafting and brainstorming essays and personal insight questions. Juggling senior year coursework with college applications may be difficult, so starting early will reduce your stress in the fall.

### Pursue Your Interests
Explore the subjects and activities you are passionate about and want to pursue in college further. Whether it’s taking community college courses, summer programs, volunteering, or internships, these experiences can provide valuable insight.

### College Visits
Visiting different colleges can help you get a better idea of how the environment, student life, and academics are, which is essential when deciding what schools are the right fit for you later on. Many colleges offer campus tours, Q&As, and information sessions.

### Have A Money Talk
Financial discussions with your parents or guardians about college are vital for the college planning process. Understanding the costs of tuition, housing, books, food, and more helps you make informed decisions when choosing where to apply. 

“This is the last year to get involved in activities, clubs, and communities that you have not done in the past, so take advantage of what’s available at CSArts,” says Ms. Shiroma, Head Counselor.
