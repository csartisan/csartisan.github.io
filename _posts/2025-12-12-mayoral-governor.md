On Tuesday November 4th, voters across the country turned in their ballots for what would become one of the most historic elections; from mayoral to gubernatorial races, democratic candidates swept the board. In New York City, Democratic Socialist, Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral race making history as New York's first Muslim and South Asian Mayor. At 34 years- old he is also the youngest New York City mayor since 1892. Mamdani's campaign focused on a grass-roots approach. He spent time talking to New Yorkers on the street about the problems they were facing, promising to work for the people and not for those in powerful places. Mamdani's biggest obstacle was Democrat-turned-Independent, Andrew Cuomo, former Governor of New York and Mamdani's opponent in the mayoral race.

Cuomo often criticized Mamdani for his lack of experience and boasted his own past political experience. However, Mamdani was quick to remind New Yorkers that during Cuomo's time as governor, multiple sexual harassment allegations came out against him and he was accused of trying to cover-up COVID-19 nursing home deaths. There has also been a long standing pattern of Cuomo handing out large subsidies to billionaires like Elon Musk. Cuomo was also accused of islamaphobia after his marketing team consistently used photos of Mamdani in his religious wear and artificially darkened his beard. In one of their debates, Mamdani told Cuomo, "What I lack in experience, I make up for in integrity and what you lack in integrity, you could never make up for in experience." Mamdani promises New Yorkers that he will freeze rents, make buses free and more accessible, and allow NYPD to focus on stopping crimes by creating a new task force aimed at helping those with mental health needs and the homeless population of New York. Mamdani will be sworn in on January 1st.

In another historical election, Virginia elected their first- female Governor. Democrat Abigail Spanberger faced Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears during her race and the economy was one of the largest issues for Virginia voters. The election, which happened during the historic 43 day government shutdown, impacted the large population of government workers in Virginia who were not getting paid. Spanberger's win is likely to be a reflection of the government shutdown and the Trump administration, although Trump was not on the ballot. Abigail Spanberger will be sworn in on January 17th and she will replace Republican Glenn Youngkin.

New Jersey also held a gubernatorial race and elected Democrat Mikie Sherril. Sherril is New Jersey's second female governor in history and she won against her opponent, Republican Jack Ciattarelli. Sherril's election marks another historical moment for the state as no one party has held the governor's seat for three consecutive terms since the 1960s. Her win also comes after President Trump lost the state in the 2024 election by a smaller margin than what he lost it by in the 2020 election.

All three Democratic candidate wins mark cautious optimism for the party after a period of Republican wins in the 2024 election.
