According to the National Retail Federation's annual survey, Americans spend about $10.6 billion on Halloween candy, costumes, and decorations every year. Nearly $2 billion is spent on candy alone, and we don’t want to even mention the dental bills afterward! 

You may be wondering how Halloween became one of the most popular holidays in the first place? It began with the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, which is celebrated every year on November 1st. It marks the day when the land of the living and dead merge. Sacrifices are made to deities and people put on costumes made out of animal skins. When the Romans conquered the Celts, the tradition was adopted, but celebrations began early on October 31st. After influence from Christianity, the celebration’s name was changed to “All Hallows,” eventually turning into “Halloween.”
