When the bathroom kiosks were introduced around a month ago, it came as a surprise to some students. With plans for these sign-out stations not previously discussed with students, there was a notable amount of feedback, 

> I get why they’re doing it, but it sucks,” 

Samson Khachatryan (CW‘25) said. The CSArtisan interviewed Mr. Metoyer, the assistant principal, to gather further information, answering the questions the student body continues to ask.

> Before I started [at CSArts], Dr. Endelman had already taken some preliminary meetings and read some literature about the benefits of a digital Hall Pass system. When I began after July 1st… I followed up with a contact to the kid account people, who we use now, to initiate what he asked for,” 

Mr. Metoyer said. 

> We’re keeping students safe and responsible for knowing where you guys are at all times. If there is an evacuation situation and someone is in the restroom, this gives us real-time information about where everyone is. If, God forbid, something bad ever happened, we’re able to go do a better job of trying to protect.” 

He adds the other reported benefits of the bathroom kiosks, saying, 

> We have received emails from multiple staff members that said students are spending less time on their restroom trips and there are fewer restroom trips. It gives students a greater opportunity to learn.”

However, the school community has been raising concerns about students’ birthnames being displayed when creating a new hall pass. Individuals who aren’t comfortable with classmates knowing their previous names are wondering if there is an incoming solution. 

> We’re working on it,"

Metoyer said, 

> There’s a few barriers. The system is integrated with our school-wide information system which means that…if it’s not on Aeries, I don’t know what someone else’s adopted name is. So we’re trying to figure out what names people are trying to use…The trick comes for those students who have not been that transparent with their parents and are using a different name. We’re going to try to sample a couple of those nicknames that are already approved to see if they could work and then have a full integration with other names.”

Another issue that has been brought up amongst CSArts students is the accessibility of gender-neutral bathrooms under the kiosk system due to the restricted amount of gender-neutral bathrooms available. 

> We’re still in our honeymoon phase, but we’re still learning, right? So what we're doing is, we're allowing the system to allow two people to go at one time, which means one person is in, and maybe one person is waiting for a few minutes, and then they can go in… So it's a little bit better as far as the transition, you don't have to wait until it's empty… And the one [gender-neutral bathroom] between the dance studios and the 200s looks to me like it's hardly ever used. The one of the 300s that I understand might be preferred, but there are other options as well.”

Dr. Endelman added that the system cost less than $2,000 dollars for an annual contract and was paid for with the state funding the school receives and not conservatory funds. In summary, the implementation of bathroom kiosks at CSArts aims to enhance safety and efficiency, with positive reports of reduced restroom time. While some concerns exist, the administration is actively addressing issues like privacy and accessibility. As the school community adjusts, there is optimism for an improved and inclusive experience for all students at CSArts.
