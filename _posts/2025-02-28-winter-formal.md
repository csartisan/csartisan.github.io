After a rescheduling because of the LA fires, the long anticipated and sold out Swan Lake Soiree Winter Formal took place at the Imperial Event Venue on Saturday, February 15th. The venue in Pasadena, was near some of the burnsites but was not damaged. Leadership was able to sell more tickets than they had hoped for because of the date change and students who had been affected by the fires were given free tickets.

“CSArts is looking forward to continuing to support our CSArts families and students during these hard times; we try to be as flexible to our community as possible,” said Ms. Cardenas, who oversaw the planning of Winter Formal and the selling of the tickets, before the dance.

“When I found out about the theme being Swan Lake Soiree, I was so excited and already started planning my outfit,” said a sophomore. “I ended up wearing a long white dress with lace sleeves!”

“It really lifted my spirits,” said a Junior. “I had been looking forward to Winter Formal for so long, and was so grateful for how supportive and accommodating our school is.”

Students danced, sang, and took photos at the photo booth. Most importantly, it was a chance to bond with friends and lighten the spirits of many students after the LA fires.
