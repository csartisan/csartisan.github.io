Did you know there are 14 religious holidays each December? Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, and who could forget the Winter Solstice! At CSArts, students celebrate different holidays from around the world.

At CSArts, we have clubs that celebrate different holidays and cultures. For Hannakuah, a Jewish holiday, Jews Clues embraces the Jewish holidays and shares that with the campus of CSArts. Hannakuah begins on Kislev 25, usually in December, according to the Gregorian calendar, and is celebrated for eight days. The Hanukkiah, or Menorah, has nine candles. It is to celebrate the miracle that one day's worth of oil lasted for eight days. Another tradition of Hannakuah is the Dreidel. A dreidel is a spinning top with four sides: Nun, Gimel, Hey or Chai, and Shin.

CSArts also supports African American students with Black Student Union (BSU). Kwanzaa is celebrated on December 26 through January 1. Kwanzaa was first created by Dr. Maulana Karenga, a professor of Africana Studies. It was first celebrated in 1966. In Swahili, Kwanzaa means “first fruits,” or “first fruits of the harvest,” inspired by various African harvests or first fruits festivals. The holiday incorporates elements from celebrations across the African continent. Kwanzaa celebrations also incorporate candles in a tradition of lighting what is called a Kinara. Kinara is a Swahili word meaning “candle holder,” for each of the seven days that Kwanzaa is celebrated. One of the seven candles is lit, representing various principles of the holiday.
