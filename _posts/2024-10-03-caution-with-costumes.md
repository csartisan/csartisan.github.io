Halloween is always exciting. It’s a time of festivities and fun costumes, but as everyone is preparing, there are some important things to remember regarding safety and cultural sensitivity. 

When choosing a Halloween costume, it is important to be respectful towards others’ cultures. Cultural appropriation in costumes can be hurtful and a serious issue and it’s necessary to avoid it. It’s especially important to be respectful on campus, in a diverse school with people from many different backgrounds. It’s important to be thoughtful about what costume you choose, and if you have a question, run it by CSArts teachers and Administrators.

The other main concern is safety. George - one of our security guards says that our school hasn’t had any major problems surrounding Halloween. “Halloween is usually pretty good here, it’s been nice,” but he still has a few tips for people who are concerned about safety. He says to avoid bringing anything that could even be considered a weapon. If you plan on bringing candy, avoid anything with nuts in case of allergies. And remember to prepare for emergencies if you’re going out on Halloween night.

Although this time of year is always exciting, we have to remember to remain conscious of our surroundings, remembering safety and respecting others.
