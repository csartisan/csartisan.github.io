The daily hustle and bustle of our CSArts campus was punctuated with the Club Rush on September 16th. The beloved annual event gave students the opportunity to join other students with common interests and make new connections during lunchtime.

From clubs dedicated to beloved TV shows like Parks & Rec and franchises like Star Wars to others devoted to helping people in need, students from all conservatories and grade levels were able to broaden their experiences.

> As an ENGin ambassador who has been with the program for a year, I'm glad I can help make a difference and encourage others to do the same,” 

said ENGin Club Leader MJ Cho, proud to be connecting Ukraine with students in California through monthly Zoom meetings and increasing cross-cultural connections. 

For those looking to “Get Involved” and “Make Meaningful Connections,” joining a club is the perfect way to have fun, make new friends, and make a difference. With the dedication, motivation, and enthusiasm of nearly a hundred unique clubs, these student-led groups offer much to the personality of our beloved campus, and look good on college applications.
