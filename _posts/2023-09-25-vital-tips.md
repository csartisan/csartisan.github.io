After a sunny and warm fulfilling summer break, students adjust themselves back into their school routines and into the academic and conservatory groove. Our performing arts students prepare themselves for rehearsal’s, while our P&D students begin to work on this year’s showcases. CSArts shows like BCD,  CMD Winter Showcase, IM’s Fall Ensemble Concert, CW’s Open Mic and our Acting showcases will be returning. Plus, you can look forward to  new exciting productions like  MT’s “Ride the Cyclone” IA’s “Mean girls'', and the Popular Music’s Conservatory first Fall showcase this year. We also can't forget this year’s all school musical “Floyd Collins”. 

All of this excitement takes hours and hours of work. If you are a new student, you will be experiencing long days and deadlines the first time! Here our upperclassmen share some tips on managing the workload and long after- school activities:

> When going through a tech week, always be prepared to be doing things! Some may think it’s extra time to be hanging out with your friends, but it's not. Just be very attentive and friendly to those you're working with... Don’t be afraid to ask for help and support, most of the time you will get it if you ask! You’ll have fun no matter what, and enjoy it as best you can. Best of luck to you!” 

- May Acero (P&D, ‘25) 
  
> Some tips for doing homework while having rehearsals is getting as much done during the breaks or before rehearsal starts. Then complete anything you can while you have time. Just making the most of what you can with the time you got” 

- Kayla Rigo (IM, ‘25) 
  
> Before my first tech week I wished I knew how little sleep you would actually be getting so definitely take time to rest and recharge. Also, I wish I knew that other people are in the same boat as me. We both don’t know the material or where rehearsal will go. You end up making new friends you never thought you would even speak to.” 

- Ines Arroyo (MT, ‘25) 

It is all about balance and using time wisely. Remember the importance of eating healthy, keeping hydrated and getting enough sleep.  Understanding what you need and your limits will be keys to success in academics and conservatory.
