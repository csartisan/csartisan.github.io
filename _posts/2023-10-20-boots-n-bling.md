We tip our cowboy hat to you, leadership students. Homecoming was an enormous success – the school can’t stop dancing! Thanks to the members of leadership, the dance was a memorable and fun experience for everyone who attended! Days of effort and planning went into the event. What were the “behind the scenes” of this year’s hoco? 

The Fairplex in Pomona hosted the first dance of the school year. All of the 2023-2024 venues were chosen last year by Señorita Cardenas, the leadership class advisor, in collaboration with a Leadership Inspirations Coordinator. 

> Leadership Inspirations is a company we hired to help support dance planning,” 

says Señorita Cardenas. 

> Our coordinator and I visited close to eight venues last year all around the area. We did a walk-through of the venues and got a sense of how many students can fit, of the space resources (for example, is there an outdoor seating area? Is there indoor? How big is the dance floor?) We ask all kinds of questions to get a sense of what venues can host our school.”

The Fairplex is covered with gardens of peppers and pumpkins, country decor, and a wonderfully rustic atmosphere – the perfect setting for a hoedown. 

> The theme highlights the venue space itself,” 

says Señorita Cardenas. 

> It wouldn’t make sense to have done [another] theme… because the venue wouldn’t have allowed for that theme. It would have contrasted.” 

The theme was decided by the entire class before moving forward with the dance preparation. 

> [Since] the venue was already picked out for us, we just planned accordingly. We all came to an agreement before starting to plan,” 

says Alyssa Cho (10th grade, Visual Arts), one of the leadership students.

The homecoming decorations emphasized the country qualities of the venue. 

> We take inspiration from the Pinterest board we created for the dance. Then some of us made an Amazon wishlist of decorations for the admin to order,” 

says Kaelin Lee, (11th grade, Acting), another of the leadership students. 

> Decorations were also made, incorporating the creativity of the committee members. The whole process was extremely enjoyable!”

Planning any event – especially a school dance – has its difficulties. Preparing for such an eventful occasion could be stressful. However, a student in the leadership class says otherwise: 

> It was overall a really cool experience – it was the first project of the year we worked on as a team. I felt really connected and we all kind of helped each other throughout the process,” 

says Alyssa Cho. Since hoco hoedown was the first project, it’s something that will be memorable to the students of the leadership class. 

> The planning process was easy, with great guidance from the dance coordinators, and the division of work ensured we were on task and everyone was doing something they liked,” 

says Kaelin Lee.

The leadership committee does so much for CSArts: they make sure all of our dances and events are as enjoyable as possible. Homecoming was a great start to a wonderful year of events – we now patiently anticipate the upcoming winter formal and prom. Leadership made hoco as magical as possible!
