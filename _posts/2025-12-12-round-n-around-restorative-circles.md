Many schools use the same discipline method: detention, suspension, and worst of all expulsion. Instead of focusing on punishment, CSArts embraced Restorative Practices which is a method centered on communication, healing, and community. Restorative practices at CSArts focus on correcting behavior, building trust, repairing harm, and strengthening relationships.

Restorative practices, a policy run by Dr. Heather Williams, is also designed to promote equality, and honor diversity.

The effective tool used in restorative practices is a restorative circle. "Restorative circles draw inspiration from long-standing cultural traditions that use circles as a way to bring people together for dialogue, healing, and community building," said Dr. Williams. "Circles are arranged so that everyone can see one another, emphasizing equality and shared humanity." A talking piece is often used to ensure each person has an opportunity to speak and be listened to in a respectful manner.

According to Dr. Williams, "Some are designed for conflict resolution and bring together everyone involved in a specific harm, while others focus on shared experiences, healing, or community-building." Usually someone is there to guide the process and act as a mediator for the conversation.

The guidelines for a circle meeting focus on establishing an agreement and the expectations that keep a safe, respectful, and inclusive respectable environment. They are used to encourage skills like active listening, respect, and trust-building. "The guidelines create a space where participants feel comfortable being open and vulnerable, which allows for meaningful sharing and collaboration toward common goals," Dr. Williams said. The atmosphere is supportive and inclusive of everyone, encouraging individuals to listen, share, and engage with each other to help build community trust and healing.

Dr. Williams helps provide a support space where students can express themselves honestly and be heard. CSArts' circles can be used in response to harm, but their impact is greater when the practice is already well-established with a person and they usually take place daily or weekly. Restorative circles are the most effective when used consistently and are well incorporated into a school's culture.
