Homecoming is a time of year to celebrate, and it can seem magical, but how much does it cost? It turns out that setting up homecoming can cost tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the venue. This year specifically, CSArts is spending somewhere between \$20,000 and \$30,000 for the venue, food, entertainment, and other costs.

Because the goal with most school dances is to break even, ticket costs need to be high. This year, they cost 80 dollars, or half as much if you qualify for the free and reduced lunch program.

So what does it all add up to? "Over the course of the past few years, it has fluctuated a lot, so it's hard to get exact numbers, but usually we make about 10,000 dollars," said head of leadership Mrs. Cardenas. So remember that the cost of your ticket goes to making Homecoming just a little more magical.
