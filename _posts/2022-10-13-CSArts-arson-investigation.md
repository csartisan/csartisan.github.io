On October 4th, two fires broke out on the CSArts campus. The first fire was in the 100’s girls restroom, and was swiftly put out by a custodian. The resulting smoke of the first fire did not set off the fire alarms. The second fire, however, was set in the gender neutral restroom by the dance studio portables. This fire activated the alarms, and was put out by security.

The school was safely evacuated during the conservatory, thanks to proper training of the CSArts staff. The Los Angeles County Fire Department arrived quickly to inspect the scenes of the incidents. Then, students were allowed to return to their normal operations and finish off their school day. 

At CSArts, student safety and security comes first, and CSArts administration is currently cooperating with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department with an open arson investigation, as well as their own internal investigation into the incident. 

> There is currently no update other than the investigation is active and ongoing,” 

CSArts admin said.

If you have additional details to report about this incident, the CSArts administration encourages them to use the Text-A-Tip line, at 240-847-4483 or to email them at administration@sgv.csarts.net.
