School events are beginning to pick up again this year and the Visual Arts Conservatory is hosting yet another Art Marketeers sale! With this exciting, artist alley- style event, a handful of our Visual Arts students will get a hand at practicing skills in customer service, networking, and product design. With business cards and creative table set ups, this event will be a wonderful mixture of both professionalism and self-expression.

Art comes in many forms and the market will be a prime example of how different mediums of art can become something practical, decorative, or even both at once. From cute crocheted hats to colorful hand sewn dolls, there’s something for everyone.

The event helps support both the Visual Arts Conservatory and the students themselves so some of the members have provided an exciting look into what kinds of products will be at the market this year.  Plans are for the event in December and March.  We’ll keep you up to date!

> I am deeply thankful to Ms. Betters and Ms. Ma for organizing this event. It’s such an exciting opportunity! All of the peers I’ve spoken to have been working hard on their products. I’m very excited to see how it all turns out,” 

said Arianna Ramras (VA ‘26)

Many handmade products will be featured but digital art can also take the form of a physical object through prints, stickers, keychains, and more.
