Summer is quickly approaching and it’s time to start preparing to make a splash for success! Other than being a perfect time for basking in the sun, summer can also be a time for pushing your boundaries and gaining new experiences. It can be a great time for students to get ahead and learn more about themselves and their passions. 

“Any work or volunteer or internship experience can be a great opportunity to teach you what you like and what don’t like about possible future career fields,” said counselor Ms. Shiroma. Students can find resources on student square or check with local community colleges. She recommends surfing these websites during the summer: “Options for Youth” at https://ofy.org and “Opportunities for Learning” at https://oflschools.org. 

Summer is a time for rejuvenation, but also exploration. Whether it’s finding a job, volunteering, or taking a few online or in-person courses, take time to invest in yourself. This extra time could also look great on college applications.
