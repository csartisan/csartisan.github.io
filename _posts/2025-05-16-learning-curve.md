After being diagnosed with a learning or processing disorder, or a mental or physical disability, students often must shift their focus to managing the challenges of their new reality. The constant questions from peers can trigger feelings of self-consciousness and anxiety. Whether it’s strangers asking about a mobility aid, commenting on stuttering or tics, or witnessing a panic attack, these experiences highlight how disorders can create significant challenges for learning and social life in high school.

According to the Child Mind Institute, the best ways to support those with disabilities are building self-confidence, finding a passion, and motivation. 

“Having a disability is just one part of their life, albeit a big part, and does not define who they are or what they can accomplish,” Education Specialist Mr. Nathan Poole said. Understanding that everyone will use an accommodation someday, whether it’s reading glasses, a cane, or a wheelchair can help shift perspectives on disabilities. Rather than directly asking about someone’s disability, which can be a sensitive topic, focusing on developing a genuine relationship provides better support and reduces stress. “Once a relationship is established, I think it’s fine to ask questions about disabilities, as long as the person’ boundaries are respected,” said Pool. If the person is openly volunteering information, asking questions is a perfect way to learn. 

There are many accommodations for students with disabilities. Using noise cancelling headphones, being in a quiet space, or extending time can support those with disabilities in the high school environment. “People with disabilities are not receiving ‘special treatment’ when they are provided accommodations,” Poole said. Working on understanding and using a calm approach is key to respecting the boundaries of those with disabilities. It's important to approach sensitive topics with care and respect, ensuring that any questions about a disabled person's struggles or life experiences are asked thoughtfully and at the right time. In a school environment, fostering understanding and empathy helps create a supportive atmosphere where all students can thrive.
