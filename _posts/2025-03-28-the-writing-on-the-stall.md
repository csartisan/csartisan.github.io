Vandalism at CSArts has been increasing. It started with the social media craze around the world with the defacement of keyboards in chromebooks, and has worsened to broken equipment and vandalized bathrooms. 

Principal of Academics Nicole Read encourages students to read the vandalism policy on the school website. Even though school administration  reviewed the policy at Welcome Week and Morning Announcements, there has been an increase in incidents and these incidents have serious consequences.

Students found guilty could face suspension, even expulsion depending on how severe the action was. “The school can charge the family for the cost of restoring the building or equipment and labor involved,” Read said. Repairing the restrooms can cause them to be closed for many school days.

The custodial staff are deeply impacted by the trend. Vandalism takes them away from important tasks that keep the campus running smoothly, and prolongs their shifts. “I don’t think students understand how tight any schools’ budgets are,” Read said. “This recent spat of vandalism has cost us thousands. That is money better spent on instruction or supplies.” 

Administration understands students’ passion for sharing their voices, but they encourage students to use the art they create in conservatory to express themselves. Students can also express their emotions to school admin and counselors, who will support and listen to their needs.
