Last week, slips were delivered to the classrooms of freshman students informing them of their schedules for the fitness tests happening from May 13 - May 16. The fitness tests are state-mandated and issued to freshmen, along with diagnostics, mental health checks, and other student surveys often given to students throughout the year. The Physical Fitness Tests assess five different categories: Aerobic Capacity (PACER Test), Abdominal Strength and Endurance (Sit-Ups), Trunk Extensor Strength and Flexibility (Trunk Lift), Upper Body Strength and Endurance (Push-Ups), and Flexibility (Back-Saver Sit and Reach, Shoulder Stretch). 

5th, 7th, and 9th grade public school students are required to take this test. While it does not affect your GPA or transcript, it is important to participate in these tests for students, parents, and staff to better understand the needs of students. According to a CSArtisan survey out of 16 students, 8 students felt nervous yet somewhat excited about the tests, 3 students were indifferent to it, 4 students felt extremely negative about it, and 1 student was extremely excited about it. 

Students were also asked if they think fitness and being in shape is important, especially while attending conservatory. “I feel like it’s not that important.” says Ysa Alcisto, a freshman in Visual Arts, “You’re going to this specific school and you’re already focusing on the arts. It's kind of hard for the student to have two things going on at once. Keeping in shape and practicing good habits are helpful, but I think it’s up to the student.” 

Other students have similar responses. “Sometimes it’s difficult to fit into my schedule with conservatory and everything, but it does help me keep myself in a good headspace,” says Temujin Bachman-Williams, a freshman in Visual Arts. “Fitness is important but I think school is more important,” agrees Ari Dawson, a freshman in Creative Writing.

A handful of students, however, believe that fitness is a large, significant part of mastering the arts. “I do think it's important to engage in fitness while honing your craft… fitness and art are similar,” says Sylvie Brinson, a sophomore in Acting. “Mentally and physically, they take time to perfect and you really have to work for your goal. No discipline means no results, for both fitness and art.” 

Seamus McGarry, a freshman in Visual Arts, adds, “I think participating in fitness while doing the arts is super important. I exercise mainly because a healthy body and physical activity are key to a healthy mind. Fitness helps to motivate you to make art and lets you be loose and expressive when making art. It’s one of the best things you can do for yourself.” 

Students with chronic illnesses have also agreed that even taking a short walk outside or doing light exercise in the gym can improve your physical and mental wellbeing, even aiding in familial ties. Dancers agree that conditioning and practice improves their performance as well.

Other ways to improve your fitness according to students include: participating in the large plethora of physical education classes at our school, doing cardio like running, hiking, walking, swimming, joining a sport outside of school, working out at the gym or at home with calisthenics, resistance and endurance training, and building muscle. 

Though CSArts is an arts-centered school, this does not mean that fitness should be viewed as an entirely foreign concept. Being in shape impacts every aspect of your life, and even putting a little more effort into being physically active can be valuable.
