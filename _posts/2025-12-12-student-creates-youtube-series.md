At CSArts there are many students who come wanting to create art in their future, and junior Austin Ewing has decided to get a head start. Ewing is in the process of creating a live action youtube series titled *Clockwork*. Ewing describes the series as a "dark social commentar--horror with heavy scientific and experimental themes."

The story is dystopian, set in present time, though the exact date is never explicitly stated. It follows a trio of main characters: Koi, Marceline, and Valentine. Vampire twins Koi and Marceline are hitmen who get hired by a company called Tidal. Valentine is the supervisor of said company. The main thing they want to accomplish is getting rid of a rival company, who are fascists against vampires, by any means necessary.

Ewing has been working on the series since 2021, though he kept it private until 2023, saying he wanted to focus on "developing the history and the world before starting on characters and story." In his freshmen year he started getting writers involved to help him produce a script.

Now, the first episode of the series has been written and is now undergoing revisions. He's been working on gathering actors for filming, so if you think you'd be interested, go to Studio C during lunch on Thursdays or 205 during lunch on Tuesdays to meet with him.
