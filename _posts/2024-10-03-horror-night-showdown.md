It’s that time of the year again: spooky season! Don’t know which parks to go to? We’ve got the info, and two teachers who offered a review of two of the most famous freight fests in Southern California.

The most popular are: Universal’s Halloween Horror Nights and Knott's Scary Farm. Knott’s Scary Farm’s general admission price is $59.99. You can also get the famous “boo-fit” with your regular admission for $74.99. Universal Halloween Horror Nights tickets are around $77. Both parks have different tier prices for express tickets. Price-wise, Knott’s Scary Farm appears more affordable than Halloween Horror Nights, but which one is better? 

We talked to terrified teachers about their experiences this year- Creative Writing Instructor Robert Blair, as he and Social Sciences teacher Michael Turf have already gone to both. Mr. Blair left Horror Nights feeling disappointed and had a better time at Scary Farms. 

> This year, you’re going to get more jump scares for your money at Knotts.  And that wasn’t the case last year.”   

Universal is known for capturing the macabre through movie-themed mazes. Knotts has a variety of mazes with different themes. 

> I mean they're both different. One’s a little campier, Knotts is campy, and fun. Universal is usually scarier with props because it's Hollywood. But this year, you  get more for your money at Knotts.” 

Blair said his favorite maze at Universal was Death Exposure: Death Valley. 

> It was like a radioactive desert and there were some great jumpscares, but for the rest of them, I was kinda disappointed. I could tell there weren’t many employees in the mazes.” 

Mr. Blair then said that if he could recommend one of the parks for a second visit it would be Knotts, “A lot more jumpscares, and campy, and fun, and a lot less expensive.”
