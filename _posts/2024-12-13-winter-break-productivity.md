During winter break, it can be easy to slide away from a schedule. Especially when you know that the first semester of school is over. However, if you do nothing all break, then it can become challenging and stressful to get back to keeping up with your work every day.
	
The best way to stay productive across winter break is to plan ahead. “At the beginning of the break make a list of things you want to accomplish during the break so you can have a little bit of structure in your time of relaxation,” said CSArts counselor Riena McMillen. As for what it is you can do during this time, she recommends volunteer hours and extracurricular activities. These are things that are hard to do when you have conservatory classes. 

It’s also important to avoid falling into unhealthy habits. Things like screen time and sleeping in late, should be avoided so that it’s easier for you to start school again once break is over.
