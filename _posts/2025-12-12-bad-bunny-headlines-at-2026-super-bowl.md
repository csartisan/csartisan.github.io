From the exciting performances of Rihanna to the thought-provoking lyrics of Kendrick Lamar, the Super Bowl Halftime Show is one of the most celebrated performances in the world. In recent years, it has become not only an opportunity to showcase popular music, but to bring about worldwide conversation.

This year's Super Bowl Halftime Show will be held at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara on February 8th. Bad Bunny "King of Latin Trap" is set to be the first Latin male artist to headline the show as a solo act. The pre-game performances will feature Charlie Puth with the national anthem, Brandi Carlile with "America the Beautiful," and Coco Jones with "Lift Every Voice and Sing."

The performance will be the first of its kind. The Puerto Rican rapper and singer has played a major role in bringing Spanish-language music to global audiences. With multiple Latin Grammy Awards, Billboard Music Awards, and one of the most streamed albums in the world, Bad Bunny has continually pushed the boundaries of music. His appearance in such a mainstream performance is a direct demonstration of the growing influence of diverse cultures in America.

"What I'm feeling goes beyond myself. It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown...this is for my people, my culture, and our history," said Bad Bunny.

"Considering the issues that are going on right now, I think it's very important to have Bad Bunny perform. America has such a strong Hispanic population and being able to honor their culture is great," said senior Miranda Cervantes.
