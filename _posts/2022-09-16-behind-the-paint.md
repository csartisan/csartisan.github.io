An underappreciated art form is finding new momentum at CSArts. New and returning students have likely noticed the colorful murals depicting diversity, creativity, and student life in an abstract form. One in particular showcases the evolving creativity of the Visual Arts Conservatory. Introduction to Style Writing, a Visual Arts class taught by one of the on-campus chemistry teachers, Mr. Mohamed, gives students a new medium and an unconventional canvas.

Style Writing covers a non-traditional art form which is not typically taught in schools. 

> Students learn how to create with this medium in a safe, structured environment,” 

Mr. Mohamed said.

CSArts gives students the opportunity to learn and grow in a way they would be unlikely to elsewhere.

Graffiti is a contemporary form of art, which originated in New York City in the 1970s. Mr. Mohamed credits the purpose of the class as a testament to the history of stylistic writing, in order to pass on the tradition of graffiti to a new generation. Graffiti is also most commonly found in locations with an abundantly diverse population. CSArts is lauded by many for its diversity and accepting culture, as it provides students of various backgrounds with equal platforms and opportunities to express themselves. 

> Students choose a name at the beginning of every year, something that is important to them,” 

Mr. Mohamed said. 

> It could be a nickname or an alter ego.” 

He went on to say that the students spend the semester creatively turning this chosen name into graffiti art. When Style Writing students aren’t spending their time painting on walls, they watch documentaries on the history of style writing, work out new ideas in their sketchbooks, and critique the work of their peers, which helps them perfect their projects. 

> Every year at the end of the semester the whole class works on a collaborative mural together,” 

said Mr. Mohamed. 

> My favorite would have to be from last year’s class.” 

The said mural was a massive stylistic writing of the words “SPACED OUT” with a green alien in a galactic background.

It’s painted over now, but come December, a new one will take its place. However, those past murals still exist, and will forever be a testimony to the history of the Visual Arts Conservatory, just behind the paint.
