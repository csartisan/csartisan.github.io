Perfume has long been a way for students to express themselves, enhance their personal scent, and boost confidence. However, while the use of perfume seems harmless, spraying it in enclosed spaces can cause problems. Students who spray perfume around the classroom,can bring on allergic reactions or cause distraction in learning. It can also be harmful to the sprayer themselves.

Many students have allergies or asthma to the strong scents, causing dizziness and sickness. Fragrances can trigger sneezing, coughing, wheezing, migraines, and rashes. “About 30 percent of the population of the United States had irritation from a perfume,” says Healthline. Sensory issues can affect students’ focus in class. According to child.mind.org, students experiencing sensory issues will have “problems related to processing information from the senses, like sight and sound.” So pungent perfumes can cause everything from minor inconveniences—to health crises. 

These scents can also create social tensions, so the harms of perfume have far-reaching effects. By being mindful of the impact of perfume, students can help create a healthier, more inclusive environment where everyone can focus on learning without discomfort. Ultimately, a fragrance-free classroom benefits everyone, ensuring that students can concentrate, breathe easy, and thrive academically without the unintended consequences of perfume use. An important note: perfume and deodorant are two different things. So, please do not stop using deodorant!
