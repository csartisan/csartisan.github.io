In early March, the CSArts-SGV Interact (Rotary) Club was recognized with the City of Hope Award. The award was for students demonstrating their dedication to serving the community. Senior Blood Drive Coordinator Francis Fong honored CSArts students Natalie Lanza, Marley Lemaire, Karina Yue, and Macy Mananquil at the Board of Trustees Meeting.

For the first time since its founding, the Interact club independently organized and hosted a blood drive in partnership with City of Hope, a nationally recognized cancer treatment and research center. More than 50 CSArts-SGV students, faculty, parents, and guardians rolled up their sleeves, each giving up a pint. Due to a blood shortage emergency across the country, these selfless actions have a large impact. In fact, a single blood donation can save up to 3 lives.

“I am extremely honored for the chance to be awarded. I am very grateful that I was able to give back to my community and make a difference like this,” junior Natalie Lanza said.

“This experience was amazing and I was honestly so thrilled to be part of it. Taking the initiative to do good is very important to me,” junior Marley Lemaire said.

As the Interact Club goes forward, members are committed to furthering their impact with new fundraising efforts, partnerships, and volunteer opportunities. They emphasize the importance of upholding their values of “Service Above Self,” every step of the way.
