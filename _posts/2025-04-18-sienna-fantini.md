Creativity is a powerful tool for expression and empowerment, and Sienna Fantini, a sophomore in the Popular Music Conservatory at CSArts-SGV, has fully embraced this with her recent debut single “Wanna Know Her Name,” available on Spotify and Apple Music.

### What inspired you to release this song?
I am a very emotional person. After going through a difficult journey of heartbreak, I wanted to properly process and let out my emotions. 

### What message do you want listeners to take away?
My experience is something that I think a lot of people have felt before at some point. I hope to let others recognize that it is okay to feel this way and help them find some comfort in knowing that they are not alone.

### What was the biggest challenge you faced?
As it was my first time releasing a piece for the public to listen to, I faced a lot of self doubt. I kept wondering if it was good enough to release and whether I actually wanted to go through with it.

### How long have you been interested in making music and what sparked your passion?
I’ve been singing since I was 8 years old and really got into songwriting in 8th grade when I was growing through the process of becoming a teenager. Music became an important outlet for me. I also liked listening to music and found lots of inspiration from singers Taylor Swift, Gracie Abrams, Role Model, and Lissie.

### Do you have plans to release more work and where do you see your music going?
Definitely! I have many songs in the works right now, so keep a lookout for them. My music has a diaristic standpoint so my music will probably be about my life: personal experiences, relationships, friends, meaningful moments.

### What would you tell other singers who also want to release music?
Just go for it! Make use of whatever you have, record and upload. Music is meant to be fun so even if you get embarrassed, just put it out because making stuff you love is the most important.
