Makeup is an artform that allows us to express ourselves via colors and patterns, textures and techniques. At CSArts makeup is exactly that, an art form. However, with the rise of assignments and homework, it has grown to be an afterthought, something that is much more optional. With that being said, it is still a prominent part of students’ lives.

Makeup, is also an outlet and an expression that crosses differen subcultures and factions becoming an ionic and recognizable feature. Sophomore Levvy Butler says makeup started out as a way for them to fit in. They say they lacked the technique and skill, but are getting more comfortable experimenting with different eyeliner shapes and colors. 

> So now, I wear makeup because I like the way it looks, and not because I want to look older or fit in or anything.” 

Junior, Violet Zeug, says she wears makeup for a different reason. Makeup is less of a routine and more something she uses to improve how she feels. “I guess it’s some kind of insecurity, as far as feeling the need to be prettier/looking nicer/put together.” For her, makeup is a tool, to improve her day and to make her feel prettier. Not only that, but it also goes with what she plans to wear. For example, when she wears her leather jacket, she’ll wear thick eyeliner, but for a more laid back look, she uses thinner and much more breezy eyeliner.

An anonymous student said that for her, makeup is both therapeutic and creative. “It allows me to vent, and paint my emotions on my face, whether that means large pigmented red and black eyeliner, or soft green, and blue eyeshadow. ”Makeup is a creative outlet for her, one that has taken a lot of practice. “I find that there is no other form that allows me to be as creative and free as makeup does.”

Each student uses makeup with different goals in mind. For some it is artistry. For others, it is to fit in, or put on a protective mask.
