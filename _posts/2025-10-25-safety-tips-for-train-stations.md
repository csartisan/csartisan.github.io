Last month, four new Los-Angeles Metro stops opened. The new Metro stops are an extension of the Metro's A-Line, with new stops located in Glendora, San Dimas, La Verne, and Pomona. Consistent riders are rejoicing in the opening of the new stops, yet with new riders beginning to take the train, safety tips are more important than ever.

The Los-Angeles Metro has finally finished its extension of the A-Line. Four new stops have debuted as of noon on Friday, September 19th, 2025. The new Metro stops are located in Glendora, San Dimas, La Verne/Fairplex, and Pomona North. The extension connects riders to nineteen local college campuses. It also connects riders to Glendora Village, Raging Waters, Fairplex, and Fox Theater. It also connects riders to the Pomona Metrolink, Pasadena, Union Station, and Long Beach. The new metro stops also connect to bus and train lines, with the Glendora Station connecting riders to the Foothill Transit Line 284, the San Dimas Station connecting riders to the Foothill Transit Line's 295 and 492, the Pomona North Station connecting riders to the Foothill Transit Line's 291 and 492, alongside the Metrolink San Bernardino Line. The completed extension affects train schedules. Trains will run every eight minutes on weekdays during peak hours, every ten minutes during off-peak hours and daytime on weekends, and every twenty minutes on late evenings and overnight.

It is essential that Metro riders, especially new Metro riders, are informed of Metro safety tips and resources. Los-Angeles Metro rides are being made safer thanks to the recent implementation of security cameras, better lighting, and a partnership with Law Enforcement. The security cameras are intended to monitor and deter criminal activity. The better lighting is intended to ensure visibility. The partnership with Law Enforcement is intended to accelerate response time.

Los-Angeles Metro riders should properly prepare themself to stay safe on the Metro. This is best accomplished by consulting Metro's suggested safety tips. Metro heavily suggests one safety tip: staying alert. Other safety tips suggested by Metro are to ride with friends, plan rides ahead of time, and report concerns to Metro officials. Metro also recommends that riders secure their belongings, stay organized, and to never run after or next to a moving bus or train.

California School of the Art's - San Gabriel Valley student, Ari Dawson, suggests another Metro safety tip: avoid individuals who making you uncomfortable while riding the train. Dawson explains, "I think it's important if something is going on, like if you hear someone making a ruckus, you should be aware of it, but do not bring attention to yourself. Try not to interact". Dawson's suggestion mirrors Los-Angeles Metro's safety suggestions to stay alert, and avoid individuals making you uncomfortable.
