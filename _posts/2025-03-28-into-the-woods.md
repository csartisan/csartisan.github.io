Two girl scouts lost in the woods, classic fairytales with a twist, and a singing wolf?  Into the Woods has it all!  Integrated Arts put on the production in the PAC January 27th to February 1st. The CSArtisan talked to some talented students and the IA director on their thoughts and experiences on bringing this phenomenal show to life. 

“A big challenge on stage was during Act II. Cinderella (Sara Fitzrandolph) dislocated her knee, so we had to adjust the blocking,” said Cami Macias (Little Red). “Even with the injury, she gave an amazing performance. It was tough seeing that happen, but I’m so proud of her and grateful to have worked with her.”

Shane Taylor, who performed as the Dance Captain and as an Ensemble member, said his favorite scene to perform was the Prologue of Act I. “I loved being able to do each different dance part, and I liked the music that I was dancing to and the people I was doing it with. We spent a lot of time on that number, and I feel like it has a special place in my heart now.” 

Meanwhile, the technical side of the show brought its own set of challenges. Gabriel Ewan, a member of the crew for Woods, said that taking down the beanstalk without being seen was tricky. 

Pianist Nicole Lebaron said that playing live music came with its own pressures. “The biggest challenge was handling those little moments when mistakes happened. But overall, the show went really smoothly, and I’m proud of how we pulled everything together!”

IA Director and Producer of Into the Woods, Joey Ancona, shared the vision that brought Into the Woods to life. “While it already has dark elements, we aimed to amplify the atmosphere with more dance, a stronger ‘creepy’ vibe, and an overall immersive experience,” he said. Inspired by Tim Burton, the team incorporated his signature style into every detail from costumes and makeup to hair and set design. 

More than just a performance, Ancona hopes the show left a lasting impact on both the cast and audience. “My hope is that the CSArts community eagerly anticipates our IA show each year, knowing it will always be fresh, exciting, and creatively inspiring. They put in so much hard work and formed such a strong bond— there were plenty of tears on closing night,” he shared. “But more than anything, I hope they feel a deep sense of pride in themselves and in their conservatory.”

With yet another unforgettable production, Integrated Arts continues to push creative boundaries and leave audiences in eager anticipation. If Into the Woods proved anything, it’s that the magic of storytelling— combined with passion, talent, and innovation—can make for an unforgettable night at the Performing Arts Center.
