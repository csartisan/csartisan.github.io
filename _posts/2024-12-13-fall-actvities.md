Although the Winter Holiday season is in full swing, it’s officially Fall until December 20th. The activities and traditions associated with it are among the best things about this time of year. CSArts students shared their favorite fall activities that highlight the most cherished aspects of the season.

Baking tops the list of activities. Students mentioned that they love the comfort and the warm feeling of the way baking warms up their homes. 

Most students claimed they liked to bake cinnamon rolls and pies. “My sister and I love to watch various movies during the fall season while we make cinnamon rolls!” said student Isabella Hernandez.

Another common activity that CSArts students liked to do was apple picking. Spending the day out with friends and the experience itself is something that students enjoy most. 
“Coming home after the day and being able to enjoy the apples was really rewarding,” said a CSArts student. 

In addition to baking and apple picking, many CSArts students also enjoy attending autumn festivals. Festivals celebrate the season through the involvement of local vendors, food, and crafts. It’s a great way to spend the day with family, enjoying the entertainment while engaging with the outdoors. 

The activities shared by CSArts students, from baking treats to spending the day outdoors highlight the warmth of this time of year. As fall comes to an end, the memories created leave a lasting impression as we get ready for winter!
