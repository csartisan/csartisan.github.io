Starting your first year of high school can be nerve-racking, especially with all the media portrayals of students being shoved into lockers and having to eat lunch alone.

"It’s my first time going to an arts high school, so I am definitely nervous.” That’s a sentence heard on campus from many new students! Yes, CSArts is different than other schools, but different is better. Yes, there will be challenges in classes and your social life. We talked to Juniors and Seniors and they are sharing 5 tips to help you adjust and make your experience at CSArts even better!

### Stay Organized
Whether you’re new or not, you are with new teachers and different classes. This comes with more homework, projects, and activities. Also, it takes a month or two to figure out teachers’ expectations and grading policies. It can be easy to lose track of deadlines, so develop a plan to stay organized, whether it means getting a planner or creating a schedule.

### Join Clubs— Explore Your Interests and Build Community!
Wanting to gather with other students who share hobbies or advocate for different communities? Clubs are the place for you! Don’t be afraid to get involved. What you put in is what you’ll get in return at CSArts!

### Speak to Teachers and Counselors for Extra Support
Whenever you’re stuck, whether with tons of work or you’re needing support, don’t be afraid to reach out to teachers or counselors. They are here to help. Write an email or visit their room during office hours for assistance. Also, remember our Wellness Center in Room 111.

### Keeping Goals & Building Healthy Study Habits
Setting yearly or even daily goals can better your overall high school life. Similarly, to have those great goals, you can construct beneficial study plans (instead of pulling all-nighters and guzzling down energy drinks). 

### Stay True to Yourself!
It can be hard to remember who you are in jumbles of identities and “cliques”, or what's hot and trendy. So, take a moment to center yourself and remember there is no one else like you! You’re important, so stay true to yourself and celebrate your authenticity!
