The Guitar Recital is home to many incredible guitarists. Diverse and immersive compositions danced and echoed through the Church of the Good Shepherd in Arcadia on April 24th.  The Guitar Conservatory and guitarists from the Popular Music Conservatory collaborated to create the Guitar Ensemble and performed numerous pieces like: “The Greenwood Tree”, “Gymnopedie No. 1,” and  “Bluey Theme Song.” The students chose the pieces they wanted to perform under the motivation and guidance of their instructors. 

The Spring Guitar Recital’s student feature highlights Zaire Franklin, whose time here was defined by dedication and hard work. He has released multiple albums on his Spotify account, “Zaire King.” He has written numerous songs and collaborated with many other students at CSArts. Inspired by a book about Bob Marley and the healing attributes of Marley’s music and expressionism, he has spent 5 to 6 years honing his skills.  “I had an old right-handed guitar that had been collecting dust for quite a while, and I decided (after reading the book) to actually try and learn guitar. I picked it up and ended up playing backwards because I was left-handed, but that didn’t stop me, and now I haven’t put down the guitar ever since,” Franklin said. In the recital, he performed an original song titled 'Velvet' with Avalon Durand. Since joining the school, he has spent time getting comfortable with a variety of guitar styles, techniques, and jazz, and has now gained an interest in practicing with different pedals and finding new harmonic and melodic routes when soloing. He will be attending USC for Jazz Studies with a full ride. 

This recital was incredibly diverse, and included:  Singing, classical guitar, instrumental rock, bluegrass, Japanese jazz fusion, metal, and original pieces. Students also performed an amazing finale, consisting of songs that three guitar instructors, Miguel Martinez, Danny Anaya, and Scott Johnson, wrote. Martinez wrote “Las Espadas Bailando En La Plaza” (translated to “The Swords Dancing in the Square”). This song is the dramatic background to an intense sword fight. Then, it bleeds into the sunset. Anaya’s bolero is called “Al Oscurecer” (translated to “At Dark”). And finally, the audience became nestled into a navy blue night, freckled with stars while listening to the beautiful Rhumba written by Johnson, “Rhumba Las Estrellas” (translates to Rhumba under the Stars). 

“I wanted to give the students a piece that felt both cinematic and personal—something they could make their own...Collaborating was energizing. We each (Anaya and Martinez) brought our own style, but stayed focused on the students—what would inspire, educate, and challenge them,” Johnson said.  He expressed that it was thrilling to hear the music that he wrote played by an ensemble of 27 students. 

Overall, this recital was one of discovery, individuality, and collaboration, and it was amazing!
