In the digital age, students have fewer and fewer tangible reminders of their time in High School. Yearbooks are one of the few physical memories students across the United States, including CSArts-SGV students, will have as a keepsake. So much time, effort, and attention to detail goes into the monumental task of accurately capturing a year at CSArts and this year, the yearbook team is releasing another award winning edition.

The yearbook team, advised by Mrs. Martinez, spends 9 months designing each year’s edition. The CSArtisan would like to congratulate Editor in Chief, Senior Cheska Dizon, Copy Editor, Junior Linhly Harwell, and the entire team on winning the Portfolio Anthology award! The yearbook team received the award once again this year, ranking in the top 1% of all books produced by high school and college students.

Capturing CSArts-SGV students as they shine brightly throughout the entire year takes many hours. 

> There's a lot of planning and late nights that go into ensuring that everything from our writing to our design to our photography is cohesive and unique and represents our school well.” 

said Dizon.

CSArts-SGV has a spirit and reputation on the national stage, and this shows in the combination of creativity and heart to produce this important collection of memories. 

> We tend to take a different approach on how we do our yearbooks, and so I think that makes our yearbooks stand out from the other 600 books across the nation,” 

said Harwell.

Congratulations on another award and amazing publication!
