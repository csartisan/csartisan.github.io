The flitter-flap of red webbed wings carry emerald critters around the campus, knocking into walls and trying to find a safe place to land. Sometimes these landing pads just so happen to be your hair and stylish clothes. These emerald critters are flying blind, crashing about and spooking onlookers who are rushing to class or enjoying a nice chat at lunchtime.

These little critters are known as June bugs because it's their most active month of the year. Adult junebugs emerge from the soil nearing the end of spring, typically May and June, greeting the transition into Summer weather. June bugs spend most of their life underground and the warmer weather and longer days activate their muscles. Most of the time, junebugs are just trying to find a nice warm place to reproduce. They may unintentionally fly into your path but these green beetles mean no harm. Their diet includes almonds, strawberries, sugar cane, roses, potatoes, and corn, which can bother farmers who grow these crops. These bugs are exploring the world but are simply blind and aren't trying to crash land into you.

If you ever feel frightened by these small little fliers, remember that they are exploring the world just like you. Remember two important things, Junebugs are blind and they are harmless.
