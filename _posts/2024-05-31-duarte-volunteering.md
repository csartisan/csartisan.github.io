With all the free time during summer break, it would be a great idea to get a summer job or volunteer! Duarte has volunteer opportunities for high schoolers during their break. There are many available options with local youth programs for people under the age of 18. You can check out the Duarteâ€™s Park and Recreation Department to get involved in community cleanups and other fun summer projects. Not to mention, it is a great thing to put on your resumes and job applications!
