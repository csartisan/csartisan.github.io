The average prom dress and suit costs somewhere in between $250-500, and on top of that, a ticket to even attend costs almost 100 dollars! If the prom expenses seem steep, there are plenty of affordable alternatives to explore, like renting attire or shopping secondhand. Everyone deserves to enjoy the celebration without financial stress. Belo
