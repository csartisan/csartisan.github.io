As someone who went through a Hunger Games phase in middle school and already ran through the Hunger Games movies, when I heard about The Ballad of Songbird and Snakes I was worried because the original movies were perfect. I hoped it held up to that standard and it DEF DID. That movie was so amazing I felt like my soul was ascending, I know middle school me was sobbing. The cinematography was gorgeous and the acting was great; except Lucy Gray’s accent that was a scare each time. It went beyond my expectations. Snow and Lucy Gray’s relationship was beautifully executed and you can see the war going on in Snow's mind. The only thing that upset me was that they didn’t go more in depth in Tigres’ backstory and what she was up to. She’s such an underrated character and the evolution of her and Snow’s relationship also kind of broke my heart. All in All TEN OUT OF TEN.
