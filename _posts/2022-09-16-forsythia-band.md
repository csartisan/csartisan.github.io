This year two Juniors take on the challenge of working hard in school, and rocking the stage after hours. The band's name is Forsythia, a type of flower, which holds true to their soft blend of rock. 

Namika Conness and Riley Arce-Riolo are returning with a booming entrance into our school's plethora of talented young artists. Their popularity is booming and blooming as Forsythia makes a name for themselves on campus. They had a busy Summer, filled with bustling gigs and playing parties around LA. 

Forsythia is seeking to expand its horizons and gain the audience of countless readily available teenagers. CSArts has provided fertile soil for them to succeed in the music business. Their talents have enabled them to enter the LA music scene with an electrifying stage presence, leaving the audience asking for more. 

Members of Forsythia are grateful for the opportunity to express and grow in their art form here at CSArts. Their experiences here have helped them grow as musicians and performers. 

> My conservatory, Musical Theater, has helped me become much more comfortable with performing and speaking in front of a crowd.” 

Riley said. The well-rounded education of academics and arts has taught the duo valuable lessons about performing in the real world. 

> My teachers have taught me that connections are very important.” 

Namika said.

Yet, there is still more to consider. The band's responses not only highlighted the skills that conservatory has provided them, they also resurfaced the annual struggle of time management as CSArts students. 

> Our school hours have definitely made it a lot more difficult to meet up and rehearse, especially since our drummer attends LACHSA and we have different school schedules.” 

The band members said. 

> We have tried to rehearse on weekdays, but our longer school hours and far commutes to each other’s houses have made it tricky.” 

Time management issues are not uncommon on this campus. Each student struggles to manage their daily tasks, social events, school work, and extracurriculars. Regardless, Forsythia chose to focus on the positive. 

> Attending CSArts has definitely been beneficial for our growth as a band and as artists… I’ve learned to have fun and just be in the moment because I’m doing what I love to do: performing and making music.”

As the long days grow longer and as we submerge into the school year once again, it’s important to stay positive and remember the privileges that come with being an arts student. 

> "[We are] constantly surrounded by like-minded individuals with similar passions, drive, and creativity.” 

Forsythia said. The band’s take on the perks of enduring long school days is crucial to remember, but it is of utmost importance to go and support Forsythia! You can follow the group's instagram at "@forsythiaband" to find out information on their gigs, music and merch.
