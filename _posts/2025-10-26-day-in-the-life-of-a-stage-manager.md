Stage managing is no easy feat, it's one of the most demanding theater jobs and requires full attention. That\'s why only a select few are chosen to take on the task. CSArts\' new upcoming acting shows, *Big Love*, *Women of Lockerbie* and *Moscow Moscow Moscow Moscow Moscow Moscow*, give new opportunities for student stage managers to step into the spotlight. It's an exciting lineup-it holds many new and unique responsibilities to the production and design students.

The stage manager for *Moscow*, Akira Mack (P&D '26), is an example of the dedication and hard work put into the shows. Akira\'s stage manager duties begin after school for rehearsals, where he is responsible for coordinating communication between the crew and cast, taking detailed notes, calling cues and much more. With only a couple of minutes to eat food before rushing away to the studios to ensure everything runs smoothly. Afterwards, he sits next to the director for the full rehearsal and takes comprehensive notes. The notes help actors identify areas of improvement and assist the crew in managing props. Usually around 9:00, rehearsals end. They need to send out emails reminding actors and staff of important deadlines and upcoming duties.

Rehearsals are just the start, once tech week begins, the stage manager\'s list of jobs expands. Tech week stretches the times of rehearsal, making it end around 10-11:00 pm. Not to mention the stage manager has to start building the black box set for the actors. While also maintaining their original roles, stage managers must learn different blocking techniques, cues and tracking the actors on stage." I've had to learn fair share rehearsal reports, block, short hand, track where the actors are on stage," Akira explains. "And practically learn another language, almost like hieroglyphics, to memorize scenes."

Although years in production and design have prepared him for this challenge, Akira reflects, " There are a lot of personal emotions with the first time stage managing. Mistakes are guaranteed to happen on large projects like these, it's the crew and actors\' ability to compromise that makes this a beautiful experience."
