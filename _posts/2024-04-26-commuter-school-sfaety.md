High School safety includes much more than fire drills and practicing for disasters. CSArts is a commuter school, with limited parking spots, and hundreds of student and parent drivers picking up and dropping off every day. CSArts is constantly updating measures to keep streets and parking lots surrounding the school as safe as possible. This includes more security guards and staff in the parking lot before and after school, the presence of crossing guards, clearer signage, and stricter enforcement of parking permits. With all of these measures in place, accidents still happen. 

On Thursday, April 11, one of the school’s crossing guards, Mr. Howell was slightly injured by a car at the Highland parking lot entrance according to Principal Dr. Gregory Endelman. Eyewitnesses said a parent was attempting to make a right turn into the lot, but didn’t see Mr. Howell in their blind spot. Paramedics were called, and Howell sustained minor injuries. Thankfully, Mr. Howell is now back at work and continuing to fulfill his vital role in ensuring the well-being of students and staff.

> It all happened so quickly. One moment Mr Howell was helping me and my friend cross the street, the next he was falling to the ground. I rushed over right away, and I am so relieved that everything is alright now,” 

Maiya Bhatt said.

Wanting to express their gratitude for his dedication, students organized a heartfelt gesture by giving him get-well gifts.

> I wrote him a card in order to wish him a safe recovery. He spreads a lot of positivity to not just the school, but the world, so I wanted to let him know that we all care a lot about him,” 

Isla Castellon said.

> Seeing Mr. Howell in the morning and afternoon is one of the best parts of my day. I am very appreciative of everything he has done, so I made him a basket full of goodies that I hope he enjoys,” 

an anonymous student said.

Approximately 25,000 accidents occur in school zones each year, according to the Transportation Research Board. Make sure to be aware of surroundings and stay safe CSArts!
