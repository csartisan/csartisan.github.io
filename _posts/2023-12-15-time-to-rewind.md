As the first semester of the 2023-2024 school year is coming to an end, let’s take a little time to look at some of the highlights of these past months. 

From the first days on-campus after Summer break to these recent winter weeks of the finals-flood, The CSArtisan has brought you the latest on some of the biggest events of the school year. This included the school-wide Club Rush, activities surrounding several cultural heritage months and school Halloween festivities. Other major events included the many concerts, performances and showcases put on by different conservatories like the Musical Theater Conservatory’s Ride the Cyclone, the cross-conservatory productions like A Midsummer Night’s Dream or Enchanted: Forest of Light at Descanso Gardens, and many more.

The CSArtisan also talked with admin to give you the latest info on the school’s new security measures. Under the guidance of Mr. Metoyer, safety measures such as live-streaming security cameras, bathroom sensors, digital hall passes, and emergency Narcan stations were implemented.	

Those weren’t the only changes our school went through this year, though. CSArts welcomed a handful of new members of the school staff, including Mr. Leon Metoyer, the new Assistant Principal, and Mr. Timothy Gomez, the new director of the Creative Writing Conservatory. A new conservatory, Popular Music, was also added, along with new course choices in some other conservatories. On top of that, the school-wide bell also got a new tune.

Additionally, the CSArtisan brought you coverage on student life and campus inconveniences (anyone remember the bees?), holiday history, environmental info, polls, reviews, and even short fiction. Our school stories were also given a platform to be heard through different media with the addition of the new CSArtisan website, as well as the newspaper’s new podcast, [CSArtisan Talks](https://open.spotify.com/show/0HJcSdDT6CnREdafnh1Ilo?si=216956326c2941d9).

Reflecting back on this semester, Mr. Blair, head of the CSArtisan, said: 

> Our student journalists and managing editors have created one of the best high school newspapers in the country. We’ve added a brand new website and weekly games, which are amazing, but what I’m most proud of is our student journalists’ constant search for truth and responsible reporting in order to be a trusted news source for the school.”

And the news won’t stop there! Be sure to look out for the newest CSArts scoops in the next coming semester– because no matter what 2024 brings, know that the CSArtisan has got you covered, with stories that will be entertaining, informative… and always the truth.
