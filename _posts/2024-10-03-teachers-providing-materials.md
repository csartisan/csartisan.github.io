Imagine getting to class hungry because you haven't eaten. Stomach growling, you walk into the classroom, and to your surprise: your teacher has a supply of snacks! For many CSArts students, this is a daily occurrence, and many teachers supply items such as granola bars, pencils, and erasers for students in need.

Dr. Williams, CSArts’ Restorative Practices Specialist believes that supplies should be provided without question, whether the student can afford to buy them or not. 

> It’s beneficial because we don’t completely know what’s going on at home, and talking about financial struggles can be a sensitive topic,” 

Williams said. 

Williams also said in an ideal world all students would be given supplies at the beginning of the year so they have what they need throughout the semester. However, if it comes to it, the priority should be given to the students who need it the most. In the end, Dr. William says, “If there's a need, supply it.”

School supplies aren’t the only things that matter in a classroom. Offering food can help students feel supported, creates more of a community atmosphere, and addresses students’ nutritional needs. 

> No one can think and work effectively when they’re hungry,” 

Williams said. 

Currently, the State of California has some of the most comprehensive programs to meet the nutritional needs of students. In the 2022-23 school year, California became the first state to provide free school meals to any child regardless of whether they were eligible for the free or reduced-price meals as defined by the federal government.
However, school supplies are a different story. Dr. Williams envisions an educational system where students are supplied with what they need, every day. 

> If a student needs a pen or a pencil, and you collect it, aren’t they going to need it for the next class? Keep the pen, keep the pencil, keep the paper, take it all to your classes, live your best scholarly life.”
