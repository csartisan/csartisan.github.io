The same word is heard every Thanksgiving: gratitude. That leaves many wondering, what exactly is gratitude? What does it look like? Gratitude is so important in our daily lives, not just on Thanksgiving.

The Personal Excellence Foundation explains how gratitude impacts teens in everyday life. Gratitude positively affects learning and mental health and hosts many physical benefits. According to the Mayo Clinic Health System (MCHS), thankfulness should be practiced every day. Gratitude can be found everywhere: a teacher helping a student in class, a cup of coffee in the morning, or a friend cheering someone up when they’re down. Gratitude can also affect sleep, a necessity especially for students staying at school until 5:00!

One way to help remind yourself to be thankful is to keep a gratitude journal. MCHS suggests writing down something positive about your day, like hearing your favorite song on the radio, a friend helping you study, or maybe your significant other supporting you in challenging times. People create gratitude lists of seven things they are thankful for. They have to think deeply, about more than only pets or family, but anything meaningful to them.

To show thankfulness to others, some may host a Friendsgiving and celebrate with their chosen family. Others invite relatives to share food and thanks. Many of us may be familiar with “Table Sharing,” where everyone at the table shares something they're grateful for. Some people even write gratitude cards, gifting them to friends, parents, or teachers. They bring positivity into the lives of others while brightening their own. Expressing gratitude is an important part of not only Thanksgiving but daily life!
