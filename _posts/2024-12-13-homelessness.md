Although December 21st is Winter Solstice this year, it is also National Homeless Persons’ Memorial Day (or very unofficially National Persons Experiencing Homelessness Memorial Day), which serves to remember people who have passed away without a home. This is especially relevant here. According to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, in 2023, 75,518 people experienced homelessness each night in LA County.

National Homeless Persons’ Memorial Day raises awareness on the higher risk of death. At the same time, it implies a call to action: people should not be dying without homes, and especially not solely because of not having a home.

To honor those who have been lost, people hold events to share their life stories and hold candlelight marches or moments of silence.

On the first full day of Winter, December 21st, the day of remembrance is an invitation to remember those who died without a home, and think about what the state and the country can do to help. Even if it’s just something small like preparing and donating a bag of necessities, or giving food to a food bank, each of us can make a difference.
