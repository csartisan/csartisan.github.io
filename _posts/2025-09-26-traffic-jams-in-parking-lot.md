Following the new school year, the amount of traffic and congestion has increased along with the many new members of CSArts. Following the rise of students joining CSArts, traffic has increased along with it. With many families traveling from many different locations, and commonly between 8:20 and 8:30 a.m.

There are many reasons for the traffic congestion. First, some students take the freeway. Many accidents occur on the freeway, which slows down traffic. Another reason that there could be so much congestion in the parking lot is, “500 families arriving between 8:20 and 8:30,” said Assistant Principal Leon Metoyer.

Some precautions and actions can be taken by parents, guardians, and students. CSArts sophomore, Joanna McGee says, “I get dropped off at the front office, and there isn’t any traffic.” McGee is usually dropped off before or at 8 a.m. and has been to class on time. The entrance to the office is located next to DHS and the Northview field.

Meanwhile, Kazuri “Kat” Bartholomaus, a junior says she is late frequently and that the front office is always the quicker route. “We usually get here at 8 or 8:20. When we get here on time or as planned, traffic is really bad…we would have to wait 15 minutes and be late.”

If you or anyone you know who struggles with this traffic wants to help, there are many things that you can do to ease the congestion. First, get to school before 8:20. Traffic usually starts at that time, so if you want to beat it, come before then. Next, when being dropped off, be ready to hop out of your car. Have your backpack on already, lunchbox in hand, and everything else safely held by you so that when your parent or guardian drops you off, you immediately open the door and get out. This will ease congestion because if all students get out of the vehicle at the same time, then the lines will be moving faster. Drivers should pull forward as much as they can to make room for other drivers to enter the parking lot. This is a team effort to defeat tardies and traffic, and now, we know what to do to be part of the change.
