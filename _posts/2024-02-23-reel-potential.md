With many students hearing whispers around campus about a possible new Film/Television conservatory, there are lots of questions to be answered. So, the big question is, will there be a new Film/TV conservatory? Not exactly. 

Dr. Cook, Assistant Principal at CSARTs-SGV says that Film, Television, and Media Technology won’t have its own conservatory. 

> We were thinking of doing a Film, Television and Media Technologies Conservatory but the more we started talking to the [other conservatory] directors, so many of the conservatories wanted to be a part of it.”

With this in mind, the school decided to make a Film, Television and Media technologies program, meaning there will be multiple classes spread through already existing conservatories. This way, students in Production & Design, Creative Writing, Acting, etc. will be able to take Film, Television and Media Art classes related to their own conservatories. 

> We thought that it would actually be able to serve more students if we offered it as a program.” Dr. Cook said. 

Another question that came to many students’ minds was how the school will be funding the new program. Especially considering the cut on this year's conservatory schedule due to under-funding issues. Dr. Cook explained that the school received an SWP (Strong Workforce Program) Grant from the state of California, which is designed to offer training to students who are looking to enter the workforce after high school. He added that this is the same grant that is being used to boost the school’s E-Sports and Computer Science programs.

The upcoming program represents an initiative aimed at providing students with a diverse skill set to meet the needs of today's job market. Across various disciplines, the curriculum will offer a range of classes designed to equip students with practical skills in film, television, and media technologies. These classes will cover topics such as camera production, acting for the camera, digital video content creation, film making, script writing, film scoring, etc. Scheduled to begin in the fall of 2025, the program will provide students with an opportunity to explore their interests and develop their abilities within a supportive educational environment. 

Although students will have to wait to take any Film, Television, and Media technology classes through our school until Fall 2025, UCLA’s Film and Television Summer Institute allows students to take classes in Digital Filmmaking, Writing for TV, Cinematography, Traditional Animation, and Media Parks. The program also allows students to experience the UCLA campus while earning college credit and networking with other emerging artist from around the globe. Students who are interested in the UCLA summer institute can find more information on Student Square or by speaking directly with their school counselor.
