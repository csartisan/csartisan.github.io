On Tuesday, April 23, pipes burst in the 200s and flooded the area. Students puddle-jumped their way to classes, as CSArts-SGV administrators made the all-too-familiar calls to maintenance to fix an area of pipes that have a history of bursting.

Upper-class students joke that the pipes in the 200s buildings have a calendar to burst every year, creating a mess in the same spot and raising questions about the school’s infrastructure. No students or faculty were hurt, no classes disrupted, and the water was shut off quickly by campus administrators and authorities. Students still had their concerns. “I think that it is important to learn in a clean environment,“ Maiya Bhat, a 9th grader said. 

Assistant Principal, Mr. Metoyer says he does not expect any other problems with the main pipe and that during the break, there are multiple projects to strengthen the campus’ infrastructure. 

> Each Summer CSArts-SGV utilizes a pre-determined budget to maintain the infrastructure, make upgrades, and prepare for the future school year.”

Metoyer is actively planning with the school’s plumbing and facility teams on the areas that require the most focus and funding. One of the areas of focus?  The bathrooms. He says that this summer, money wil go “to enhance the restroom experience for all CSArts-SGV staff and students next year.”

The dry season is the perfect time for work on infrastructure, with students and the rain gone. During the winter, however, due to our school’s location near the foothills, we are at Mother Nature’s mercy, as climate change fuels stronger storms, heavy rainfall, and gusty winds.
