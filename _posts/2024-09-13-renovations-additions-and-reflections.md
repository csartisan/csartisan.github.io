CSArts is known for its areas of green grass areas around the campus where people can sit, eat, or take a nap. But with the smoky weather and the heatwave, it’s been difficult for students sitting outside. Now, the campus has new places to hang out indoors! As Assistant Principal Leon Metoyer promised last year, there’s new furniture, ranging from chairs, sofas, and tables indoors! It’s given the campus a new look and more space for students!

Plus, you may have heard about the major technological upgrades in Room 203. “...that included an upgrade to the electrical infrastructure, new gaming computers, monitors, and paint to create an Esports facility on campus. In addition, the gym restrooms have been upgraded and we are also working on an upgrade to internet servers,” said Metoyer.	

Along with these upgrades, you can check yourself out in the mirrors near the studio bathrooms. Squeezing behind a bathroom door wasn’t the easiest way to check if your hair was messed up, and CSArts students are grateful that Admin listened to their requests. 	

> As someone who does makeup and wants to look their best, it’s kind of important that we have mirrors.”

> As a guy, I think they’re useful, but not really for me,” 

> I glance in the mirror sometimes, but otherwise I don’t use them.”

> It’s a little random, it just looks like bathroom mirrors outside,” 

This year’s changes show that CSArts listens to students, their requests, and concerns. So, if you have ideas to make our campus better, talk to an administrator.
