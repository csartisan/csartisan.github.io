Earth Day just passed, but that doesn’t mean we should stop caring. Some environmental issues won’t fix themselves, including micro- and nano plastic pollution, which have recently been raising serious health concerns for life on earth, including threats to fragile ecosystems, and cancer. 

To get a perspective on how microplastics affect the environment and how students can help, we talked to Mr. Crumley, who teaches Honors Biology and BCD/CMD.
	
> It [microplastics] could have an effect on you epigenetically, which means it could actually change the genes.” 

He adds that it could also cause hormone imbalance.

How do we avoid plastics when they are all around us? Mr. Crumley recommends buying boxed water, using reusable water bottles with filters (he recommends the brand Soma), or buying glass or bamboo containers. 

> Look into what you’re buying… because what you purchase is funding and telling the individual or company that you want this product… they’re gonna make it easier to get that product done and most of the time, it’s through plastic. Consider what products you’re using, what you do with those products after you’re done using them,” 

Mr. Crumley says.

We also talked to Ms. Read, about environmental consciousness at school. 

> Our cleaning staff regularly swaps out for safer and greener products,” 

she says. Admin have installed water bottle refilling stations, and “set certain metrics on the AC units so that they don't kick on too soon and further stress the grid.”

For students who want to use less plastic, she recommends bringing lunch and water bottles. It’s also helpful to avoid buying synthetic fabrics like polyester, which release microplastics when washed. 

We’ve taken so much from the Earth. Isn’t it time to start giving back?
