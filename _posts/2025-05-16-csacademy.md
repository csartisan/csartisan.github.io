Looking for things to do this Summer? CSAcademy offers classes for everything from “Theatrical Makeup design” to “Embroidery” to “Dungeons and Dragons: A Beginners Guide to Adventure.”  The classes are sometimes even taught by the same teachers.

Dr. Stephen Cook says “CSArts Academy classes are a great option for summer students ages 8-15 who desire a summer camp experience that focuses on the arts rather than sports or outdoor activities.” There are only three weeks of the summer where these classes are taught and there isn’t time to go very deep into the subject but that can be a plus. “The classes are meant to introduce students to many different art forms (from ceramics to stage combat to digital animation) and - though instructional - are taught from the most introductory level so students with no experience can feel comfortable participating.” Anyone can take these summer classes and they can add a lot to your summer. The classes can be an easy and fun introduction to something new, or even just something to refresh your knowledge of the art. 

For the full list of classes you can visit CSArts Academy Summer 2025 Brochure of Classes by Orange County School of the Arts which contains details about each class at OCSA and CSArts-SGV.
