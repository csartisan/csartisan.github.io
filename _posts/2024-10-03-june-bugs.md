Green patches of grass throughout CSArts are filled with students laying down and enjoying their break. That is until June Beetles invade. June bugs are known for their beautiful green fluorescent shell, but they have been known to fly into students’ heads and hair. This is a new phenomenon at CSArts and the green bugs may be here because of the new greenery on campus.

There is a myth that June Beetles are blind, but according to Bugology.com, the beetles can see; they are just clumsy fliers! They are also a great alternative to pesticides, because they kill harmful soil dwelling insects.  

Yes, with the Beetlejuice sequel on the big screen, these bugs may be getting a bad rep. Yes, they are not coordinated fliers, but these green bugs have a purpose: to get rid of harmful insects. So, “Bee” kind the next time you see one flying clumsily through the air.
