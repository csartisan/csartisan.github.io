Everyone has heard about the big musicals like Into The Woods and Once Upon A Mattress, but what about the smaller performances? What about workshops? The Acting Conservatory has been putting on smaller performances called Play Readings. These readings showcase students’ acting abilities in a smaller, less professional setting. The performances are made up of multiple scenes that are acted out by the students.

“We only had two weeks to rehearse so, a very short time,” said Freshman Araceli Prasarttongsoth, who is in the Acting Conservatory and performed in Metamorphosis. Since the rooms normally used for performances, like the cafeteria, were occupied, this play reading took place in room 301 in the music building. Although these performances are not as extensive and well known, they represent the student’s work and their progress in acting. It is important to recognize all the performances CSArts put on, the big and the small. If you are intrigued by these performances, some of their actors are performing them in the upcoming Season Finale for the school. We hope to see you there!
