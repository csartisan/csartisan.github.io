With reports of viewers fainting after watching the new horror film, Smile, millions flocked to the movies to see what the hype was about. However, many left the theaters unimpressed. Twitter wars popped up all over the web with conflicting opinions on the film. After scrolling through countless comment sections, I decided it was time for me to settle this myself.
Told through the eyes of a psychiatrist, who never recovered from her own past traumas, Dr. Rose Cotter starts experiencing a supernatural phenomenon she can’t explain. This film’s plot dealt with complex topics of mental health intertwined with the enthralling twists and turns of a modern horror film. Throughout the movie, the smiling faces do not lose their gut-wrenching horror and kept me on my toes. However, despite the thrilling jumpscares, certain aspects did fall a flat. The villain of the story was not outside of the ordinary horror genre and many agree that the ending felt a bit cliche and left much to be desired. This is not to say that I didn’t enjoy it. With the chilling visuals and uneasy tension, this movie is a great way to scratch a horror film itch.
