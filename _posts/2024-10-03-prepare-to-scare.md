If you haven’t experienced Halloween at CSArts-SGV, you are in for a (trick or) treat. While other schools restrict wearing costumes to class, CSArts rolls out the red carpet for students and staff alike to show off their creativity!  

> The variety of student costumes is incredible. Teachers and Administrators take part in the fun as well,” 

said Social Science teacher Mr. Pegan.

> A CSArts-SGV halloween actually gives West Hollywood a run for its money.  It’s a holiday based on creativity and costuming, so of course, it’s a huge deal!”

said Creative Writing Instructor, Mr. Blair

CSArts hosts an annual costume contest judged by teachers and administrators. Teachers usually have a theme too, but it is a guarded secret until October 31st!
