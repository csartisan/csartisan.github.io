Sometimes bad movies are really good. Ask any Stephen King fan if they liked the latest MAX movie, Salem’s Lot, and you are likely going to get an ear full.  But, If you know nothing about  King’s 1975 book, and have never seen the other versions, it’s actually an entertaining film!  

If you're in the mood for a chilling journey  through the darker corners of human nature and the supernatural, Salems Lot is an entertaining hour and 53 minutes.

The made-for-TV movie brings the small town of “Jerusalems Lot” to life, with vampires and even creepy children with fangs.The director, Gary Dauberman, creates an eerie atmosphere, making the town itself a character. The story centers on Ben Mears, a writer who returns to “Jerusalem Lot” to face his past, and ultimately comes face to face with evil. As the townspeople begin to change in strange ways (and grow fangs), Mears realizes he is up against forces beyond his control. Yes, there is little character development, but that means there are no “sappy feels” for the vampires victims. Plus, eerie silences will leave you on the edge of your seat, and jump scares will leave horror lovers screaming with delight.  It’s campy; it’s cheesy; and it’s not going to be up for an Oscar Nomination, but Salem's Lot does entertain. You can Watch Salem's Lot on MAX.
