LA freeways are known for being crowded, and the parking at CSArts has the same reputation. Many students believe that the traffic is worse than ever before. 

> It’s been bad for the last few years,” 

senior Eliza Kim, said. 

Creative Writing Conservatory instructor Mr. Blair says, 

> There is no quick fix. We have to be patient. The school’s in a tough spot. They can't make more space because there’s not more space. They have to be creative.” 

However, an effective solution to the parking problems is on the way.

> We are going to be redesigning the campus at some point,” 

said Dr. Endelmen, CSArts principal. The “big picture,” is to build permanent classrooms to replace the current 400s buildings and dance studios. This will give necessary space to expand the parking lot, and install more parking spaces. The goal for the needed changes is set for completion in the next 3 to 5 years.

Last summer, the admin made new designations for student and teacher parking. Spots are numbered, and security has been tightened in order to make sure parking guidelines are being followed. Also, CSArts tried easing the parking pain by adding around 10 new spaces, but this still does not solve the bigger problem.

It is not just a matter of too little space, it’s also a matter of behavior behind the wheel. 

> There are behaviors and norms that people can do to make things less bad,” 

Dr. Endelman says. He reports recurring problems with cars blocking the entrance to the lot, as well as cars parked in incorrect places. The principal encourages drivers to adhere to the signs, listen to directions from crossing guards, and pay attention to their surroundings. 

The CSArts community, with guidance from admin, is taking steps to finally end these pressing parking problems.
