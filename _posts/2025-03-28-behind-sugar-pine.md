If you’re ever hungry for a sweet story to read or delicious artwork to consume, take a look at Sugar Pine! Sugar Pine is the Creative Writing Conservatory’s annual literary journal. It began when CSArts was first established in 2017, founded by the former Creative Writing Director John Blaylock. The book was named after a type of pine tree common to the San Gabriel Valley area. Creative Writing Director Timothy Gomez currently oversees Sugar Pine. 

Sugar Pine is made up of fifteen people this year. Students spend long hours creating the literary journal, beginning with submissions in December to final publication in May. Senior Dominic Anaya Gulaya is Editor in Chief this year, while Gomez acts as the adviser. Students serve in many roles: main editors for prose and poetry, the layout lead who decides what the book looks like, and readers and editors. During the process of reviewing submissions for the book, the readers and editors will look over a portion of the pieces submitted before getting together and debating whether to include a piece or not, making Sugar Pine a very collaborative process. 

Sugar Pine does not make any money, as printing costs are high. Infact, the goal is to actually break even. Donations from parents help with the cost, and whatever profit is made from sales, is sent back into the Creative Writing budget. 

The long-awaited launch of this year’s Sugar Pine is during the sixth Open Mic Night for Creative Writing, Thursday, May 22nd.
