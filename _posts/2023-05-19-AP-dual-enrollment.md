Every spring, students at CSArts debate on whether they’ll take AP courses or Citrus College classes. For some, this debate goes on throughout the summer, and some hope for the best in the fall about their decision. But even after having put in so much thought, is one actually better than the other? 

On one hand, AP courses tend to have a higher demand of students interested rather than Citrus classes. This is due to the prestigious look of it on transcripts, as it shows that students were able to challenge themselves throughout their high school careers. 

Although even with such advantages, AP courses also have their downfalls; they demand a strong work ethic and resilience. Throughout the year, students are expected to prepare themselves for the final AP exam through countless homework assignments and lengthy tests. This can be hard for CSArts students to manage considering the extra work of conservatory many have to manage, as well as rehearsals and shows to prepare for. 

In addition, college credit for these courses is also not always guaranteed. According to the CSArts handbook, students will only receive credit after passing a two to three-hour-long exam. This is a huge deciding factor for most students, considering that if you fail the exam, then you may feel that it was all a huge waste of time and money, since the exams usually cost a certain fee in order to take the test.

On the other hand, Citrus College courses differ between subjects depending on if it is popular during a certain year. The difficulty of these classes ranges depending on the subject. 

Overall, Citrus College courses  can be considered to be the “easier” option because of the automatic college credit granted if students pass the class, no matter what. These courses are also free of charge, and are a lot less anxiety-inducing when it comes to exams and credit. 

Dual enrollment courses, like AP classes, also offer a GPA boost for students. However, some students seem to dislike the structure of Citrus College classes, considering it isn’t your typical high school class, and while it can be good practice for college, it can be a hard adjustment for some people. Grade formatting isn’t the same as in regular classes, and student and teacher relationships can be hard to establish depending on the class. There are also many student complaints about the Canvas platform used in Citrus classes, due to the confusing structure of grade reports and assignments. Therefore, all aspects of AP courses and Citrus College courses should be taken under consideration before making a decision on which to take. 

As students prepare for the upcoming school year, it is also important to hear what their counselors have to say about AP and dual enrollment courses. Counselors will be able to help students take in both pros and cons of the two choices and support them in coming to the best decision. 

> For students already enrolled in an AP course, it makes sense for them to take the test at the end because you already work so hard the whole year. So, might as well take the exam and see if you can get college credit for it. Although if you are debating between taking an AP course in the fall or a CCC college course, it all depends on the student. Both can give you college credit but dual enrollment is automatic just by passing the class. For the AP courses, you have to pass the exam. So personally, I am biased, and I would lean towards the dual enrollment classes,” 

said Ms. Shiroma, one of the counselors here at CSArts.

Teachers who teach these college level courses are also a great source for more in depth information regarding the course, considering they are highly aware of student habits and common experience among the school population. 

> The fact that the college credit all comes down to one exam might be stressful for some students. On the other hand, having to focus on preparing for an exam might provide some students with a clearer vision of what they need to do in the class. Of course, both AP and CCC classes are going to have college level work expected… In terms of deciding, it is important to think about whether you want to focus on taking an exam or not. The AP exam is a multi-hour exam, and it will require extra preparation time outside of class. The CCC class doesn't have that type of all or nothing exam but it does have several writing assignments that are challenging. The courses are just different and one might work better for different students,” 

said Mr. Pegan, who teaches the community college course for US history.

School staff and students have very distinct perspectives on whether or not which course is better, and opinions vary based on your plans for the future and your current circumstances. Students who experience the courses firsthand have a more valuable take on how both courses can affect their academic or social life. Here is what some students had to say about their experiences in both courses: 

> The dual enrollment classes can sometimes have an exaggerated workload which can interfere with your personal life but in the end, I’d say it is less harsh than AP courses” 

- Alina Ayala (VA ‘25)

> Citrus classes tend to be less manageable and more professional, leading it to be more difficult. Although sometimes it can be the better route to go down because AP tests are expensive and it isn’t as important when you’re an underclassman” 

- Kayla Rigo (IM ‘25)

> AP classes are decent as long as you keep up with the work. They also have very helpful benefits if you take advantage of them” 

- Joann Cruz (VA ‘24)

> Emotionally AP classes are overwhelming to a degree, depending on the student. They have their advantages academically but it takes a lot of commitment. Depending on the subject I would take an AP class again” 

- Maddalena Cano  (VA ‘25)

In the end, there is no “perfect” option for every individual. The demands of the classes differ and the factors that come into the decision-making such as testing, course work, and even what one wants in their high school experience. There are pros and cons to both sides, but the best choice is to go with what suits you the best.
