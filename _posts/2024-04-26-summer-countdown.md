### Anxiety During the Countdown to Summer

With only two months left of school in the Spring semester, the heat and stress is on for seniors. We got into college, what happens next? What’s going to happen on our new journey? Have I made the right decisions? And seniors aren’t the only ones with worries as the countdown continues. 

Mental Health should be a priority during this stressful time of year. Since summer is coming up, some students are struggling with the challenges of being stuck at home for 3 months.

### Tough Times and Test Taking 

This month, CSArts freshmen, sophomores, and juniors took the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress. If you’re an underclassman, dont worry too much: the State only has access to junior test scores. Students' scores do not affect their grades in class, but are used as a measurement tool by the State of California. This, however, does not negate the early start and stress of the test taking season.

Sophomore AP students will be taking their first AP test of their career: AP World History. Juniors and Seniors taking AP tests and finishing Citrus College Courses. They are feeling the heat, and we’re not talking about Spring temperatures.

Just a reminder, if you need support, CSArts counselors are available to talk with you when you’re having a tough time. You're also invited to go to the Wellness Center at Room 111. The Wellness Center has several stations to help with stress, anger, and more! Whether you just need a few minutes to destress, take a breather, or process feelings with supportive people, the Wellness Center is a safe space for you. It’s available from Blocks 1-6. Mr. Austin and Mrs. Miranda is there to create a peaceful environment where students feel safe and secure.

Some important dates that students should keep in mind are the following. There will be no school this Monday, April 29th. AP testing begins on May 6 and continues on until May 17. Our last day of conservatory is May 9th. Seniors, don’t forget, Prom is on May 18! Graduation for seniors falls on May 31 and the last day of school lands on June 4th. If you are a senior and feeling overwhelmed CSArts has created a “Senior To-Do List.” You can find it at [csarts.net](https://csarts.net).

Remember, don’t let the added stress of these events bring down your overall happiness. Just stay focused and clear your mind. If you ever experience burnout, fatigue, depression or anxiety, take some time to yourself and allow yourself to heal in your own way.
