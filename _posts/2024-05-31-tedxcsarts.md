TED Talks are coming to CSArts-SGV in 2025! So, if you’re a passionate speaker wanting to improve your craft while exploring bold ideas and sparking meaningful conversations, this is for you! If you have a vision for positive change and innovation in your community or beyond, this is right up your alley! And, if you’re eager to develop your communication, leadership, and critical thinking skills in a supportive environment, TEDxCSArts is headed your way in 2025!

Next Spring, CSArts-SGV will launch TEDxCSArts giving students the opportunity to create, get coached and critiqued, and deliver their own TED Talks in collaboration with the big guy in red known as “TED.” (TED isn’t a real person-but stands for “technology,entertainment, and, design)

Plans are still being ironed out. If you are interested and want more details, you can contact Creative Writing Conservatory Director, Timothy Gomez at [timothy.gomez@sgv.csarts.net](mailto:timothy.gomez@sgv.csarts.net)!
