The largest part of the CSArts campus is a secret hidden in plain view. The Northview Field is a large part of our campus, mostly used for certain PE classes such as Taekwondo. There is significant confusion among the students that has led to many people believing that the CSArts field is closed off to all students during all three breaks. But, this is simply not true. The Northview Field is open to students as long as you aren’t in class. In fact there were students on September 3rd who were lounging in the shade by the building. 

“We’ve been open with only a few exceptions. If we’re using the field for a parking lot, obviously not those days. And if there is extreme weather we’re not doing it on those days,” said Assistant Principal of Facilities & Supervision Mr. Metoyer.

Metoyer also mentioned one more rule: students need to be supervised by a staff member present on the field at all times. He spoke about a struggle with finding available staff for this task, which is likely a reason for the confusion among the students.

So then CSArts students, as long as you follow the rules, the field is your domain for all field-related activities.
