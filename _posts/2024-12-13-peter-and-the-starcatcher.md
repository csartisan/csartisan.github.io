The sea roars and two boats collide. A father, Lord Aster, and his daughter named Molly, get separated in the process. Pirates take over and the story continues on highlighting the main character of the story, Peter Pan before he was given his iconic name.

The Musical Theater Conservatory performed an amazing production of Peter and the Starcatcher, a prequel to Peter Pan. It was an upbeat and comedic show showcasing characters like Black Stache and his sidekick Smee. Pirates try to steal the treasure of Lord Aster, but Peter, a young orphan boy, helps Molly get the treasure back. A love blooms between the two and Peter goes through many other obstacles such as meeting mermaids and getting his full name Peter Pan. Action and humor mixed in together to create a wonderful and laughable show that everyone enjoyed on opening night. 

“This show is Peter Pan’s backstory. The highlight of this show is the swimming scene.” - said an anonymous Production and Design student.

“My favorite part of the show is definitely the mermaid scene. It was so much fun to do. This play is a prequel to Peter Pan and it's kind of about Peter, his upbringing as an orphan and how he ends up getting his name and finding his family.” said Ev Cullen, who played Lord Aster.

Look for CSArts next major production of Once Upon A Mattress, the all-school musical, January 16th-18th.
