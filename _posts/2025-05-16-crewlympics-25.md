The Production and Design conservatory isn’t usually under the spotlight. That’s about to change at this year’s third annual Crew-Lympics on May 22nd.

Crew-Lympics tests P&D skills in Olympic-style games. P&D adopted it from other technical theatre departments. “It was a way that we can have our students showcased front and center onstage,” said director of P&D Adam Roy. “Typically when they’re doing their jobs well, the audience doesn’t notice them at all.” 

The games range from fake food prop designing or audio mixing contests to scene change or quick change races. There’s roughly one game or contest for each P&D area of study, which fall under the umbrella of three tracks: Scenery and Props, Costume and Makeup, and Theatre Technologies.

For a bigger picture, CSArtisan talked to three P&D students about their work and experiences in P&D. 

“When you do big shows, you always have to expect that you’re going to stay later for at least two weeks, so you always have to clear your schedule around this time,” P&D sophomore Luna Nguyen said. 

Luna has been in multiple P&D roles, including deck crew (moving set pieces), props crew (organizing the prop table), and sound board operator (managing sound cues). She was also the assistant stage manager for Into the Woods. “It gets pretty hectic sometimes,” she said. “I tend to run backstage through the crossover a lot just to be able to communicate with the other people who aren’t on headsets.” 	

Senior Jayden Abogado also worked on Into the Woods, by designing costumes and running the costume shop in room 206. There, she filled out budgeting papers, sewed, and gave tasks to other students in the costume crew. 

Sadie Ondich is a rising junior who is also interested in costumes and makeup. This year she worked on the Fall Festival and on the makeup for Arsenic and Old Lace. One day she hopes to be a head of a Costume or Makeup role, like designer, artist, or manager.

P&D is the beating heart of any production whether it be helping set up a black box production at the PAC or carting supplies to off-campus plays and musicals, they are essential to the success of CSArts. Crew-Lympics is a way to celebrate their skills and accomplishments so make sure to purchase a ticket if you can!
