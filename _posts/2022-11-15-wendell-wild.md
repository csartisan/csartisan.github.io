Henry Slick, director of Coraline and Niel Geiman (creator of Coraline and Wendell & Wild) return to feature films! In collaboration with Netflix, Henry Selick brings to life a Netflix exclusive stop motion horror comedy.

The film is a great example of a fantastic stop motion film! Other than the jaw dropping animation this story comes to life with endearing characters that will keep you on the edge of your seat till the end. First of all, unlike Coraline, Wendell & Wild has a diverse set of characters, including great LGBTQ+ representation. Although it is a fun movie, in the end the story had a lot going on and the ending seemed a bit lacking. The story was great, but it seems that it would be better off being a mini series, rather than a movie.
