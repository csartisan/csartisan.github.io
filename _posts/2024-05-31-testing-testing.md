Every Spring, 9-11th grade students endure a week of state testing. The week is long and the rules are strict: no computers, no phones in the classroom, even after students finish the computerized tests. So, what are these tests?  Why are they so important? The CSArtisan has done the research for you!

The focus of state testing is on the Junior Class. 11th graders take the California mandated CAASPP test, which collects important data including academic performance and determines how the school ranks compared to other state schools in California. 9-10th graders take “interim testing” which the California Department of Education defines as a formative assessment. That data can help teachers pinpoint exactly where students need more help. 

> It’s a great way for students to practice, but the scores don’t count towards anything.” 

Says Ms. Read, the Assistant Principal at CSArts. 

While the Interim testing can be thought of as formative, the CAASPP test is summative and has real effects on schools and students. The state requires a student participation rate of at least 95% and if that percentage is not met, it puts the school in legal jeopardy and in danger of receiving corrective action from the state. 

> One incentive the school uses to keep our participation rate over 95% is valedictorian status.” 

says Ms. Read. 

While state and Interim testing can be a bore, it’s important for students to understand the effects that they can have on CSArts and their school experience.
