The 400's alley now has gates bookending it, and security guards keeping vigilance. 

CSArts administration recently made the decision with the goal of keeping people from entering or leaving campus through the alley during the school day. 

“Our first job here is to keep students safe,” said Assistant Principal of Facilities and Supervision Leon Metoyer. “You can’t do that if people can just walk in and out of the gates whenever they want.” He didn’t respond to a request for comment on if the gates were also meant to secure campus from ICE.

Each of the gates has a keypad that students can open with the last four digits of a student ID. These are available on Aeries and on student IDs, and are different from cafeteria pins.

The gates are much narrower than the chainlink fences from past years, so there are now three bottlenecks between the 200s and 400s. Take a detour by the studios if you’re in a rush!
