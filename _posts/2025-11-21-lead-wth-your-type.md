The CSArts-SGV Interact Club is back with its annual blood drive. Held on November 14th in partnership with City of Hope, the drive is an opportunity for students, parents, and faculty to give a gift that truly saves lives.

"Being able to do something that directly benefits cancer patients is very important to me. It's inspiring to see how CSArts students continue to impact the community, and we hope to see an increase this year," said Natalie Lanza, president of the Interact Club.

Blood drives are essential in ensuring that patients have the resources they need to continue fighting. Nationwide shortages and declining donor turnout have made donations more valuable than ever.

"It's a simple act, but can truly make a difference for the patients at City of Hope," said Francis Fong, Senior Blood Drive Coordinator. "Even in my own life, my son was diagnosed with leukemia when he was just eight years old. Thanks to the treatment he received and the generosity of blood donors, he is now a two-time leukemia survivor and recently celebrated his 25th birthday."

Appointments can be made by scanning the QR codes posted around campus. Walk-ins are also accepted. Donors must be at least 16 years of age, weigh a minimum of 110 pounds, provide a valid photo ID, and be in good health.
