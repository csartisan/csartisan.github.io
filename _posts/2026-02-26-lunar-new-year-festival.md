At CSArts, the Asian American and Pacific Islander/Chinese Culture Club commemorated the Lunar New Year by hosting a festival. Students and staff from all backgrounds were invited to learn, connect, and celebrate.

Lunar New Year is a vibrant celebration that brings communities together while honoring centuries of tradition. Observed in China, Korea, Malaysia, and several other Asian countries, the holiday begins with the first new moon of the lunar calendar. In 2026, it fell on February 17th and marked the Year of the Horse in the Chinese zodiac. Although customs vary across regions, the occasion centers on family reunions, paying respect to ancestors, and welcoming prosperity.

“I wanted to bring the Lunar New Year festival to CSArts because I think it’s a great opportunity to share AAPI culture with the school community. It’s a fun way to get everyone together, eat good food, and simply enjoy the atmosphere,” said junior Katie Chiang, president of the AAPI Club.

The festival featured a variety of performances and interactive activities. Students played mahjong, a 4-player tile-based game originating from China; jianzi, a traditional Chinese sport involving feathered shuttlecocks; gonggi, a Korean game involving _gonggitdol_; and made origami, the Japanese art of paper folding. The Chinese Culture Club, Dead Film Club, and Liberty in North Korea Club also partnered together to offer a taste of Asian foods, including ramen, baozi, and hwachae, and highlight the importance of cultural awareness.

“I’m really grateful to see the school’s eagerness to embrace different cultures. Being able to learn about other people’s cultures and sharing your own is very important,” said senior Carlie Wong.
