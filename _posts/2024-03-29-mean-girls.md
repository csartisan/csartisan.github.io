Popular pupils and sassy songs hit the PAC stage in the IA Conservatory production of Mean Girls. During the February production students' talent and hard work were on display. As the spotlight illuminated the stage, behind-the-scenes efforts and teamwork brought this musical adaptation to life. 

Joey Ancona, Integrated Arts Conservatory director, says a collaborative spirit and robust funding made the show a success. 

> Producing a musical akin to Mean Girls can demand a budget exceeding $30,000. This includes expenses like securing rights ($7,000), covering production essentials such as lighting rental, scenery supplies, projections design, and costumes ($15,000). Plus, there’s the cost of compensating key personnel like the director, choreographer, and music director ($8,000).”

CSArts encourages cross conservatory projects, and with Mean Girls, Production and Design Conservatory students lent their skills and talents. 

> Their practicum students contribute significantly to the show's design elements, offering a remarkable opportunity for these budding designers to showcase their talent," 

Ancona said.

A show of this magnitude cannot hit the stage without  help from student families and the community. 

> Ticket sales and family involvement are absolutely vital! We rely solely on word of mouth and social media for advertising. Families play a pivotal role in spreading the word within the community, assisting with tech day meals, and generously donating props, costumes, and other necessities."

Whether on stage or behind the scenes, students said their experience was unforgettable. 

> It was such a great experience, super rewarding, and the show is amazing. It’s such a stacked cast; everyone is so amazingly talented and they are all just so fun to hang out with too,” 

Lauren Zavala, who played “Caddy,” said.

> My favorite moment of Mean Girls was hyping up my friends during 'Whose House is This?'. It was only a few of us who were on stage, but in the back, we were hyping up and dancing, it was so much fun,” 

said Samantha Rily, who played “Regina”

The experience of putting a show together this large, not only helps students grow in their respective skill sets, but also in learning how to work together. 

> I think that the show is really good, everything was put together, and it all came together…everyone did their parts accordingly, and it just pulled everything together, and it was just amazing in general,“ 

Alina Kaptain, from P&D Conservatory said. 

So, what’s next behind the curtain? The CSArtisan tried to get the scoop from Mr. Ancona. His reply? *"It’s a Big Secret!"*
