After years of anticipation, planning, and allocating funds, CSArts finally has an esports team! Created by junior Emily Su, in collaboration with Mr. Read, the roster includes: *League of Legends*, *Valorant*, *Counter Strike 2*, *Super Smash Bros.*, *Mario Kart*, *Apex Legends*, *Marvel zrivals*, *Rocket League*, *Hearthstone*, *StarCraft 1 and 2*, *Overwatch*, and *Fortnite*. CSArts has hosted an assortment of tournaments in the past being *Valorant*, and *Mario Kart*. Prizes have been up to $100 for teams this year. 

If you are interested in applying for an esports team, club leadership, junior Lily Mortellaro says it’s simple. “All you have to do is scan a QR code for the application, fill out the form, and wait it out.” 

The club was created thanks to lots of planning, Lily shares. Some struggles they worked through included getting students interested, and then scheduling tournaments. While there are no tournaments on the books yet, there are plans for a *Fortnite* and *Marvel Rivals* tournament in the near future. Overall, if there are games in the CSArts Esports club roster that you find interesting, it just takes a QR code scan; and you can get gaming!
