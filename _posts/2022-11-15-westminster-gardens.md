The Visual Arts Conservatory celebrated the spooky season by showing off and teaching their skills to the seniors of Westminster Gardens in Duarte. On Friday October 28th, the Visual Arts Community Outreach Club members were able to collaborate with the elderly and help them paint pumpkins.

> We are on a mission to celebrate this season by decorating pumpkins with senior citizens at Westminster Gardens! As the new president of this program, I’ve been working very hard to organize this coming event with Ms. Ma and Mr. UYoon,”

said club president, Phoebe Mak (VA ‘24). 

The mission was indeed successful. Students and seniors took on the pumpkin painting challenge and embraced the Halloween spirit. 

> It was a nice opportunity for the seniors to connect and just talk with the students while doing a fun activity together. I can't wait to see what awaits the VA Outreach Program in the future!" 

said Mr. Yoon, the VA Community Outreach Program Club Advisor. 

It was an event of collaboration and creativity. Everyone created their own pumpkins, some scary and others adorable. Once their masterpieces were done, everyone shared their new spooky creations.
