The countdown to the long awaited AP exams has begun! High school students at CSArts and around the country have been putting in the hard work all year to pass the test for possible college credit. Throughout different classes, many methods and practices are being implemented to better benefit and prepare students. “For AP US History we are reviewing material and studying specific key concepts from each unit that is broken up by historical moments,” said Junior Maya Pavik.

These final weeks before the big test days in May are being used carefully and wisely. Certain teachers are hosting practice tests to help students feel more comfortable. If you are struggling there are resources to help, but your teachers are going to be best equipped to prepare you. 

“College board does have a lot of resources but it’s not gonna feel like enough. So if you are eager to really prepare yourself for the test, ask your teacher questions, review your notes, go back to your previous units,” said Vice Principal Sean Kerr. “Be confident, even if you’ve struggled in the class, go into the test and feel really sure of what you have invested your time into.”

While AP tests may be a big deal, it is always important to remember to have balance. Plenty of rest and nourishment is just as crucial as studying when it comes to the outcome of these exams.
