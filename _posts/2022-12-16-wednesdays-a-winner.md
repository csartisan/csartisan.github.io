Wednesday, more like Wed-slay! It’s official: directed by Tim Burton and starring Jenna Ortega, Netflix’s newest original series, “Wednesday,” is a hit. Three weeks after its release, the show has already surpassed “Dahmer,” for Netflix’s second most popular English-language series of all time and has amassed a staggering billions’ hours worth of views. A coming-of-age, murder-mystery, comedy with a supernatural twist, offers something for everyone to enjoy. 

However, Jenna Ortega’s masterful portrayal of this protagonist’s snappy comebacks, edgy personality, and dogged pursuit of the truth is what truly has fans obsessed. “The enduring appeal of characters like this – an admittedly toxic outcast with inherently good intentions – is the desire for every weirdo to feel seen on TV,” writes critic Janelle Zara in How Netflix’s Wednesday became a pop culture phenomenon.  

On the surface, “Wednesday,” seems like your typical teenage mystery spin off– the kind that Netflix has attempted with “Riverdale,” an adaptation of the Archie Comics or the “Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.” But underneath, there is a compelling coming-of-age story about learning to take responsibility for one's actions and their effects on others. As Wednesday navigates through this mystery and her new school, she is also tasked with the teenage task of repairing the damage she’s done to her relationships. Tim Burton’s “Wednesday,” is undoubtedly one of the best series to premiere this year, and it is wholly deserving of that title.
