‘Tis the season for festive films! Whether we’re lighting up candles for Advent or Hanukkah, listening to Santa songs, hanging up stockings, or simply kicking back with a cup of hot cocoa and blankets to relax, there are hundreds of movies to choose from, but which of the classics beat them all?
The CSArtisan polled students regarding their favorite holiday film. Students were given options or could write in their favorite. And here are the results! (Drum roll please):
The 1st place for favorite movie was tied with A Charlie Brown Christmas and Elf, at 25%. The second favorite? Die Hard with 12.5%. Rounding out the top 3 were 4 movies tied at 3rd place: A Christmas Carol, It’s a Wonderful Life, How the Grinch Stole Christmas and Nightmare Before Christmas at 8%.
The results bring interesting conclusions of how the timeless Christmas classics were less popular than silly, lighthearted movies (or Die Hard, which doesn’t have the warm feels usually, but still lies in the genre, just as an outlier.)

Some students chose to write in their favorites which include: Home Alone, Scrooged, Klaus, and Eight Crazy Nights.
