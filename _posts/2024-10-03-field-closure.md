During the past few weeks, Northview Field and the back of the PAC were set off-limits, followed by the temporary closure of several restrooms. 
Student use of the field during lunch and office hours has been suppressed, due to a staff shortage. Vaping has been a consistent problem on the field, and there have been multiple reports of students smoking. Administrators say that in order to open the field back up there needs to be more supervising staff.

> We’re actively looking to hire a campus supervisor, we sent multiple things to try to find someone who fits our school and is talented and capable enough to do the job,” 

says Leon Metoyer, Assistant Principal. The school is hoping to gain more security, to supervise the field and open it back up. Metoyer says that when they do get more staff, the field will definitely be open. 

Vaping has also been an issue in the gender-neutral restrooms in the studios. They are also closed during office hours and after school because of vaping. 

> That is when 80% of our vape sensor detection alarms go off. I’ve been told by students that that is like a place where a lot of people vape. So right now, we’re a little short on staff as far as campus supervisors are concerned, so that area is closed,” 

Metoyer said.

Additionally, administrators added a gate in the back of the PAC. 

> The gate’s there … to make sure our students and staff and faculty are secure. It’s always been a restricted area, and now there’s a gate,” 

Metoyer said.

Administrators and security are working on hiring new staff to re-open areas where students enjoy spending time and keep our campus safe.
