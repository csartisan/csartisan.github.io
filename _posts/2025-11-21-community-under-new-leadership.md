"Wherever art is going in the world, we should be able to provide that for our students," says Allison Hennessey, the new assistant principal of the arts at CSArts. With that philosophy in mind, she is stepping into the role with a vision to inspire both students and teachers alike.

Hennessey has been with CSArts since the school first opened in 2017. She was the Chair of the Dance Conservatory. Even after her move to Ohio, she stayed with the school. With Dr. Cook's resignation as Assistant Principal of the Arts, she decided to apply for the open position.

With a strong foundation in dance, she emphasizes that leadership isn't about controlling every corner of the arts program, but about trusting the experts who surround her. "I believe in supporting people so they can flourish in what they do," she said, explaining that trusting each director to lead their programs is central to her approach.

"Sometimes with growth, there also needs to be a moment of settling into them...and really fulfilling what we already have," Hennessey said. With the addition of the Popular Music Conservatory and the 6th-grade program, the school is allowing some time for easing into those expansions. So, we won't be seeing any drastic changes made to the Conservatories. Instead, she and her team will focus on improving current conservatories and on supporting Conservatory directors and teachers to provide the best programs for students.

As she steps into her new role, her goal remains clear: to strengthen a community where every artist, teacher, and student can thrive.
