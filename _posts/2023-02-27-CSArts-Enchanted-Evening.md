As we settle into the second semester of the school year, it's time to celebrate! On February 4th, CSArts students gathered together to dance with their friends at Winter Formal, held at the Springfield Banquet Hall. The theme of the night was Enchanted Evening, and many dressed in their finest dresses and suits, some with florals, lace, and greens and purples to match the theme.

> “For this year’s winter formal theme, we wanted to go for a fantasy vibe, something that was really different from homecoming, Neon Nights. The venue had a whimsical feel and the potential to portray a fairytale scene.” 

Jolene Young said, one of the members of the CSArts Leadership dance committee. During the dance, the venue was decorated with a variety of fairy lights, flowers and vines, helping to create a truly ethereal atmosphere to the event. However, despite the beautiful decorations, some were apprehensive of attending the event at first. 

> “I was kind of worried about distance and finding people to spend time with, but that ended up not being a problem at all. I’m glad I went!” 

said Rosie Williams (VA ‘23)

When asked about the process of choosing a venue, the dance committee said, “all venues are chosen prior to the school year by the leadership advisor. For these venues, the advisor looks at the venue capacity and having various spaces to accommodate all students. We also take into account the location, finding a place in the middle ground.”

No matter the distance or theme, all that were at Winter Formal can confirm that it was truly an enchanted evening to remember.
