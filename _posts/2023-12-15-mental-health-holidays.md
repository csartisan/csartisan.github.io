As the holiday season approaches, we can all appreciate the jolly atmosphere and our unique celebrations to end the year. Although many of us look forward to this time of year, it also brings struggles for many, especially those who have complicated relationships with their families and personal identities. We aim to recognize and validate the hardships of many during this holiday season, and provide some comfort and guidance to all those who aren't feeling the most merry and bright.

The holidays can be especially stressful for LGBTQ+ students and family members who feel pressured to either conceal or hide their identities around their loved ones. Family gatherings can be a major source of anxiety and discomfort, especially regarding gendered gifts and personal conversations with other family members. The pressure to conform to family expectations or hide one's true self can be overwhelming, and the sheer stress of holiday preparations, such as gift buying and event planning, can add to the emotional burden.

In light of these challenges, The Trevor Project says it's vital to practice self-care and utilize the resources available. Simple strategies like setting boundaries, making time for relaxation and hobbies can be incredibly beneficial and can take some of the stress out of those uncomfy dinner parties or gift exchanges. It's also important to stay connected with supportive friends or communities who understand and affirm your identity and feelings– thankfully, in the age of the internet, it's easy to maintain regular communication with those who help you feel seen and appreciated for who you are.

Make sure to reach out for help and comfort if/when you're stressed! Additionally, practicing mindfulness when needed are also key steps in maintaining your mental well being– it might take some effort, but conscious patience and the use of grounding techniques can go a long way, in stressful situations and in general. 

For those questioning their spirituality, the holidays can intensify feelings of doubt or isolation. It's crucial to remember that questioning is a natural part of personal growth, and that there is no shame in having questions. "Holidays are supposed to be about peace, hope, and love. Conversations about differences in faith or politics can wreak havoc at the dinner table. Your faith journey is personal, so boundaries by having a plan or a phrase when challenging topics are brought up, can be incredibly effective. This will keep the  peace between relatives and yourself," said Mr. Blair, who is also a minister and chaplain.

Seeking support from experienced members of your community can provide comfort and guidance during this season.

While the holiday season can be a time of happiness, it's essential to recognize and address the mental health challenges it may bring in both yourself and others.If you or someone you know is struggling, the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is available at 988, and the Crisis Text Line can be reached by texting HOME to 741741.
