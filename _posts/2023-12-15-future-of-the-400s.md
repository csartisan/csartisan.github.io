If you’re a student at CSArts, chances are you’ve had a class in Diagon Alley, better known as the 400’s. Rumors of termites, deterioration, and admin losing the 400’s have spread around the school. But what’s true and what’s false? 

Dr. Endelman, Principal at CSArts, says he had no knowledge of termites or deterioration in the 400’s when asked about the problems.  

> There’s certain things that get sent to me, and then there’s a lot that just never get sent to me,” 

he said. He said teachers' complaints sometimes bypass him and are sent to a team responsible for repairs, so not all information goes straight to him. 

Regarding the future of the 400s and whether or not we would be losing them to Duarte, Dr. Endelman says. 

> It’s partially true,” 

referring to Duarte wanting the 400s back. 

> They [the portables] have served as a temporary hub, and that was organized by Duarte. We entered a lease agreement with Duarte but we pay the leasing company, not Duarte.” 

He was able to give the cost to lease the portables which was over $1 million annually. 

> That lease is getting ready to expire,” 

Dr. Endelman says. 

> So the big question for all of us is what are we going to do about it?” 

After the completion of Duarte’s new sports complex, they are interested in getting the space back for a parking lot. But admin also has big plans for the land that the 400s sit on. 

> The long term solution is to get rid of the 400s and close off that backside of the school, letting the school end at the studio portables/PAC and let Duarte High have their parking lot back,” 

Endelman explained. 

> My dream is to have permanent buildings.”

Dr. Endelman says the most probable location would be Northview park or replacing some of the portable dance studios with permanent buildings. 

> We’re already having high-level conversations with the school district and the city about what those plans could look like… It’ll take time and money to get these things accomplished, but I am very excited for the future growth of the school.” 

Dr. Endelman said there currently is no definitive timeline for the plans.
