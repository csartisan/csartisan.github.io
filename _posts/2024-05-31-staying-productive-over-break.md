By this time of year, a lot of us are ready for school to end. Now that we’ve made it to summer though, what do we want to do with our time? While it’s important to rest, it’s a good idea to use your time productively.

Summer is a great opportunity for learning. If you’re aiming to catch up or get ahead, the Options for Youth (OFY) and Opportunities for Learning (OFL) organizations offer a free July program with a range of classes like History, Spanish, and Electives (talk to your counselor if you’re interested.) Or, you can complete summer workbooks, reviewing what you learned. It’s also a good idea to study for College Board tests, research for college, scholarships, and careers, or get some volunteer or work experience (see [“Volunteer Opportunities in Duarte"](/duarte-volunteering) for more).

On the non-academic side of learning, you could take advantage of the break to explore your hobbies and interests. For example, you could resolve to cook more or practice a form of art you’d learn in another conservatory.

Whether you’re trying to catch up, avoid summer slide, take a step or two ahead, or just make the most of your summer, it pays to be productive.
