The California School of the Arts was founded in 2017, and during these 8 years, it has already made a mark and a difference in the lives of its students. The school was officially established as a charter school and formed a public-private partnership with the Duarte Unified School District. The school has rapidly grown since its founding. In the first year, the school’s population was around 700 students. Now, it’s 1200. CSArts was originally created by OCSA, so more prospective students could get a chance to explore the arts. Many of its classes and conservatories are modeled after the Santa Ana school as well.

Mr. Turf has been a CSArts teacher since day one. 

“I would say the overall energy of CSArts and the range of students–how everyone comes from all over–it’s such a diverse group and yet we all connect and feel like family.” 

Turf said during the first year at CSArts,  there was no senior class which explains the smaller number of students the first year. With the addition of a senior class and the school becoming more popular, CSArts has grown substantially.

“Having small classes was nice, of course, but CSArts has grown so much and it is such a good thing, and I am so proud of the school CSArts is today. Students today are so passionate about their conservatories and it’s so interesting to see all these different artists with different backgrounds and talents. I will say though, one thing I miss from the earlier years was no bathroom lines!”
