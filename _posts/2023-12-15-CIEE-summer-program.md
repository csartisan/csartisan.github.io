How does it sound to travel to Latin America, Europe, or Asia with other highschool students with the same interests as you? During Summer 2024, CSArts highschool students are eligible to apply for the CIEEE study abroad program!

CIEE is the largest nonprofit organization in the country that focuses on studying abroad. It gives the option to choose sessions ranging from stem, arts, business, social change, and language/culture. The program offers classes to extend students’ knowledge from marine science, marketing innovation to anime. After a week of lessons, on the weekends students get to go on fun activities and hang out with friends. 

Not only is this a chance to refine college applications, it’s perfect for students building college credit. There are more than 35 destinations you can choose from to stay for 3-4 weeks. The classes are interactive and rich in building cultural assimilation. Each year CIEE is able to support 40, 000 students, and even if the tuition isn’t 100% covered, the program provides scholarships that can grant full rides that will cover transportation, meals, activities, and more.

This is a great opportunity for students to immerse themselves in new cultures and meet people from different backgrounds who happen to want to broaden their horizons along with you.
