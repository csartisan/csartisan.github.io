CSArts' Annual Battle of the Bands is tomorrow, April 19, at 5:00 PM! Tickets are available in AudienceView. It is $20 for adults and $10 for students and seniors. This exciting performance consists of multiple student bands - from CSArts and neighboring high schools. Contestants will play sets of songs to battle for the winning title. Judges will grade them based on vocal ability, instrumental ability, cohesiveness, balance, stage presence, professionalism and efficiency. First place will win $200 dollars and an exciting four-hour recording session at Lily Pad Studios. Second place will win $150 and third will receive $100.

A member of one of the competing bands “The Arnolds”, Ysa Alcisto, said there’s a balance of  excitement and nervousness for tomorrow’s contest.  

“It takes a lot of practice and preparation… It’s fun, it really is, but sometimes schedules get all mixed up and some people end up not coming to practice.” Come tomorrow to see our fabulous student bands play to become the victor at the Battle of the Bands!
