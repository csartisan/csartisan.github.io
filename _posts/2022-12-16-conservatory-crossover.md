CSArts Conservatories invite all students to explore their passions, to search for a good fit with their interests and talents. Sometimes, that means switching conservatories. Dozens of CSArts students plan on transferring conservatories next Fall. This month, many students have prepared and submitted their transfer applications, and CSArts believes there is no shame in finding a better fit.

> Generally, students switch conservatories because they have become immersed in the artistic culture of the school and have found other areas that interest them more,” 

said Dr. Cook, the Dean of Arts. Students may also wish to advance in specific subjects, like ballet or painting, and choose their new conservatory accordingly. 

> The benefit for transferring to another conservatory would be to focus on another art form that has become a new artistic passion,” 

said school counselor Mrs. Shiroma. CSArts students are surrounded by a wide variety of forms of art and opportunities every day. 

> I have friends in different conservatories. I think that gave me a perspective of what it would be like in another conservatory, and of the other possibilities at CSArts,” 

said Sienna (IA ‘26). Those changing conservatories could also have experienced a change of interests. On the other hand, some wish to pursue their current or original interests. 

>My interests haven’t really changed, but talking to other people, I’ve realized that where I want to be is not where I am now,” 

said Sienna. Some students, especially freshmen, are switching from Integrated Arts to other conservatories. 

> I think the classes in other conservatories are more leveled than the classes in IA,” 

said an anonymous student. 

> In IA you start with beginner classes in lots of different subjects.” 

Many see the Integrated Arts conservatory as a great opportunity to experience all that CSArts has to offer. Those transferring from IA choose the art form they connect with the most.

> Visual Arts seems pretty cool,” 

said Sophia, a freshman currently in Creative Writing. 

> I draw a lot during class to help me focus and pay attention to my teachers, so I should probably be in a drawing conservatory!”

Student applications were accepted until December 9th. Though the due date has passed, those wishing to change conservatories can still apply at the beginning of next school year. 

> Current CSArts-SGV students are welcome to apply for a conservatory transfer once per school year,” 

said Mrs. Shiroma. 

> Current students wishing to apply to a new conservatory must submit a complete conservatory transfer application and participate in a new conservatory placement activity.” 

High school is the perfect time to explore your interests. Better now than half-way into your career!
