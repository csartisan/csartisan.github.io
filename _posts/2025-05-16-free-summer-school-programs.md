Have you ever wanted to get ahead in school? Maybe retake a class over the summer? Or do you want to get a boost before your next year of school? If this is true for you, looking into summer programs is an amazing option. 

“Aren’t those all super expensive though?” you may ask. Well, they don’t have to be.

There are many summer school programs that don’t cost any money at all.  CSArts school counselor Mindy Shiroma explained that the CSArts Counselor Corner website can provide information on these resources. The website lists free summer school programs where students can earn credit for school. The main programs highlighted include California Community Colleges and Opportunities for Learning, and Public Charter Schools. Another key factor to consider is whether or not the school will accept the credits given by the summer school programs.

“We will accept anything that is WACA (Western Association of Schools and Colleges) and UC approved,” said Shiroma. If you are unsure if a program is UC approved, you can visit the University of California A-G Course List. If you are looking to retake a class, students also have the option to take CSArts summer school courses. Hopefully, being aware of these options and resources will allow CSArts students like you to earn the credits they need!
