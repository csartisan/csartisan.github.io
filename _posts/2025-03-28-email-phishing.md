If you check your school inbox often, you may have seen an email from a “classmate” inviting you to collaborate on a document. At first glance, it seems harmless, but clicking the link would’ve taken you to a fraudulent page asking for details, like your school login credentials. This email was actually the most recent example of a phishing attempt faced by CSArts, a deceptive tactic used by cybercriminals to steal personal data.

Understanding phishing is crucial, especially when an estimated 46% of all email traffic is spam, much of which contains malicious content like the example above. Phishing is a tactic used by cybercriminals to gain access to sensitive information such as passwords, Social Security numbers, addresses, and banking details. More advanced scams can even install malware on a victim’s device.

While some scams can be harder to spot than others, there are some precautions that may protect you from falling victim to an attack. "The best thing to do is take your time," says Asa Merrigan, CSArts' tech support. "Scammers often try to rush you by using phrases like ‘Immediate action required!’ so you overlook red flags." He advises verifying the sender’s email address, stating that, “Scammers may claim to be from Amazon, but their email address might be a random string of letters and numbers.” Other telltale signs include poor spelling and grammar, which can indicate a fraudulent message.

Many CSArts upperclassmen may have noticed an increase in phishing attempts compared to when they were underclassmen, and there’s a reason for that. "Technology is always evolving, and that means network security can sometimes be compromised," said Merrigan. "If attackers find a new way to access a system or discover a loophole, they can exploit it to send out phishing scams."

Phishing attacks on schools are becoming increasingly common. A study reported by NPR found that 108 U.S. school districts fell victim to phishing scams in 2023 alone. These attacks not only cause stress and disrupt normal operations but can also lead to significant financial losses for school districts. Some of the most severe cases escalate into ransomware attacks, where cybercriminals gain access to a school’s network and hold it "hostage," demanding a ransom for its release.

While large-scale ransomware attacks have occurred in some districts, they are still rare. Merrigan reassures that CSArts is more likely to experience smaller email scams, like the ones students have already encountered. "If a student clicks on a phishing link, they will probably only have to worry about changing a few passwords," he said, encouraging any students who believe they’ve fallen victim to a scam to visit him in his office for assistance.

As phishing scams become more sophisticated, it’s crucial for students to stay vigilant and proactive in protecting their information. Cybercriminals rely on deception and urgency to trick victims, but by taking simple precautions such as verifying senders, avoiding suspicious links, and staying informed, students can reduce the risk of falling for these scams. CSArts is constantly working to improve cybersecurity measures, but individual awareness remains the best defense.

By recognizing the warning signs and reporting suspicious activity to Tech support, students can help prevent phishing attempts from spreading and protect not only themselves but also their peers and the school community. As Merrigan emphasized, if you ever suspect you’ve been targeted, don’t panic! Seek help, change compromised passwords, and learn from the experience. In a digital world where cyber threats are always evolving, staying cautious and informed is the key to staying safe.
