AI is cool because of the millions of gallons of water keeping its data centers from overheating.

The more energy a model needs, the hotter its data centers get. Sometimes fans cool them down, but when the center is very energy intensive, it needs water. So, the centers use filtered or drinking water (most convenient) in closed loop water systems to cool it. Most of the water evaporates on the way.

Business Insider recently discovered that 43% of planned or existing U.S. AI data centers are in places where water is extremely scarce. Some have permission to use millions of gallons of water each day. In California, there are about 300 AI data centers.

CSArtisan talked to computer science teacher Jake Read, who has started to research the environmental effects of AI data centers. "They're getting highly discounted and subsidized municipal water rates," Mr. Read said. "That's a business strategy, whatever keeps costs lowest."

The amount of water the centers use is unsustainable. "The numbers I was seeing were that in 2030, the levels of consumption will basically reach a height where they can't use that system anymore," said Mr. Read. Some solutions are to substitute salt water for fresh water, build a system that keeps water from evaporating, or keep building data centers in oceans or in the arctic.
