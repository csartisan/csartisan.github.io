Behind the windows and doors of the CSArts kitchen, the cooking staff works hard to bring the delicious food we eat everyday. They start their meal preparations early in the morning, before students even get to school. 

The kitchen staff prepares breakfast, snacks, and lunch each day. Asmik Yaghisjian, the kitchen manager, says she cooks breakfast with only the help of her assistant, Norma. Then, other kitchen staff arries, and they prepare for their busiest time of the day: lunchtime. Most of the food is made from scratch in the kitchen. 

> Some of them I create, others I just use recipes from my culture,” 

Yaghisijian said. Just this week, when the temperatures got cold, the CSArts kitchen staff made homemade pozole! 

> This food is downright gourmet, and definitely better than any other school food I’ve had. We are so lucky to have the wonderful cooks here at our school,” 

said Mr. Turf.

On the topic of recipes, what is the difference between staff and student food, is there even a difference? 

> I used to make a bunch of different food, but now it’s almost all the same, we have the same salad bar and hot food. Only the Thanksgiving food is different.” 

Yaghisijian says. She said she started the job of cafeteria manager because it allowed her to cook and work with the opportunity of a good amount of vacation days. 

The kitchen staff is part of the Duarte Unified School District, but Kismiq and the staff’s work assignment is at CSArts, and we are grateful for their hard work, and love that they put into each meal.
