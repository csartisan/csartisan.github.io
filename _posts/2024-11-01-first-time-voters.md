Early voting is already underway!  Next Tuesday, millions of Americans will head to the polls to vote in local, state, and national races. Some seniors will voice their choices as a vital part of democracy for the first time. If you’re a new voter (age 18+) or are eligible to register (age 16+) The CSArtisan Spoke with AP Government Instructor Timothy Skinner, students, and staff, and  have tips for you for Election Day, November 5th, and in the future: 

1. Take the time to research the candidates and issues on the ballot. California has an extensive voting guide online at: https://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/
2. Plan Ahead: Make a plan for when and how you’ll vote. Whether you’re going in-person or voting by mail, being organized can help reduce stress on Election Day.
3. Discuss with Others: Talk about your thoughts with friends, family, or teachers. Engaging in discussions can help clarify your views and deepen your understanding.
4. Local Government matters!  Do not let the noise of the presidential election overshadow the importance of local leaders and policies that directly affect you..
5. Trust Your Instincts: Ultimately, it’s your vote. Listen to your values and beliefs,
6. Celebrate the Experience: Remember that voting is a privilege and a key part of participating in democracy. Enjoy the experience and take pride in making your voice heard! Wear your “I Voted” sticker and put it on social media

Some seniors aren’t at the legal age to vote but still want to prepare until the time comes. One of these Seniors, Abigail Risbon, had this to say when asked if they prepared for voting in any way. “I try to read through every unofficial ballot my parents receive and keep up with the news. One thing I would like to do more is keep track of important political events. Not just debates but movements in the house and legislation as well.” 

When we asked Timothy Skinner about his own experience voting for the first time he said: “ When I voted for the first time, I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness [...] I was a bit overwhelmed by the responsibility of making an informed choice. That experience really shaped my understanding and importance of staying informed, which I strive to pass on to my students today.”
