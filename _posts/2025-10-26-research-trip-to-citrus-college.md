How do you make a dual enrollment CSArts student feel like a Citrus College student?

Step onto a college campus. On September 12th, 55 students in Mr. William's CCC English class spent a Friday at Citrus College to get help with their TED Talk research projects and explore resources.

In the past, CCC English blocks have talked with librarians through virtual Zoom meetings. This is the first time they went in person.

"I figured that by introducing students to the campus, actually exploring the resources, and meeting the people on campus, they'd feel more like citrus owls," said Mr. Williams.

Students began their day at Citrus in the Hayden Memorial Library. Librarian Elizabeth Cook helped students access online databases for their project

They also toured the Learning Center, which has a testing room for students with accommodations, and a writing center where students can receive tutoring for papers or speeches.

"Any student at CSArts who is in a Citrus College dual enrollment class can access the writing center," Williams said.

Students can also join Zoom sessions or send a quick email to the writing center.

Mr. Williams plans to repeat the field trip in the spring semester. Last week, Ms. Cook also visited his classes at CSArts last week to bring banned books for another research project and share additional resources.
