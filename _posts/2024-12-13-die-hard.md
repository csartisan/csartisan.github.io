Die Hard is a Christmas movie, and if you haven’t watched it: go watch it. You’ll agree. You should. Because it is.

The entire plot is driven by Christmas, and the word “Christmas” is used 18 times during the movie. The attack happens on the building because it is a Christmas party, making it easier to take hostages. Bruce Willis is in LA because of Christmas, so he can talk to his wife (who’s name is Holly) at this Christmas party, and since it’s Christmas Eve he thinks it’ll be better to talk to her. 

This has been a source of contention at Christmas dinner tables for years.

Dish Network polled more than 100 people regarding this Christmas conundrum.  79% of people believe Die Hard is indeed a Christmas movie. 

According to press release from DISH Network, 1.3 million Americans watched Die Hard on Christmas Eve in 2016.

Even though it’s obvious that Die Hard is a Christmas movie, some important “Die Harders” disagree. 

Star, Bruce Willis declared: “Die Hard is NOT a Christmas movie.” 

He’s wrong. 

The movie has a ton of signature holiday songs in its soundtrack: “Winter Wonderland,” “Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!” 

Plus, Bruce Willis wears a Santa hat. What else do I have to say? Ho, Ho, Ho!
