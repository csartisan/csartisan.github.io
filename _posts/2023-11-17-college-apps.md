As the time to submit college apps comes closer and closer, stress builds as students are trying to complete their applications. The college application process can be an overwhelming experience for high school students. From choosing the right schools to crafting compelling essays, applicants often find themselves needing guidance. The CSArtisan interviewed some students on how they are feeling about college applications.

> I think college applications have hard parts, such as putting in academic classes, but I think my essays are going good right now,” Ryan Hori (VA ‘24)

> I’m feeling stressed. I haven’t really started anything out, so I’m worried I’m going to do things wrong,” Tyree Dilihay (VA ‘24)

> It's going a little bit better since early decisions and actions have passed. I think if I stay on top of it, I’ll be fine. As of right now, I am not, so it is getting a little stressful as the deadline is approaching,” Justin Cheng (IM-P ‘24)

Some students are ahead of the game, and have already gotten accepted.

> I’ve gotten accepted to a couple of colleges already and I’ve been offered some scholarships. I have applied to Azusa Pacific University and then a couple of smaller colleges in Scotland,” Vira Dowdle (MT ‘24)

AP Literature teacher  Emma Thompson,  hosted one-on-one sessions to help students compose and revise college essays.

Students said it helps to have more than one pair of eyes on their applications and appreciated the extra help.  

> In the meetings, we went over examples of other essays and saw what parts of them were good and what wasn’t, and different ways to make your essay more interesting,” said Aleen Kojikian (VA ‘24)

School counselors are available to help with any college application questions in room 100 during office hours. They will available through the end of this semester.
