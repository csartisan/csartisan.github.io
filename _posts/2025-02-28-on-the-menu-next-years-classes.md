The year is going quickly, and questions on what classes to choose next year are popping up. How much more work would taking an elective mean? Is a Citrus College Class better than Honors? And do you really need another AP course? The CSArtisan has done the research for you!

According to school counselor Mrs. McMillen, the most important thing to look for is balance. “Never have more than three AP or college level classes at once, for health purposes and for balanced classes,” McMillen said. Many students already have a schedule filled by conservatory, rehearsals, and long commutes. A day of three back- to- back college-level or AP classes is often just too much. 

There are also many new classes available for students. The elective list now includes AP African American Studies, CCC Art History, Crafting Workshop, Cinematic Arts, and Competitive Hip-Hop 4, which requires an audition. Seniors can now take CCC government, sophomores can now take CCC World History, and anyone who has taken Spanish 3 can now take CCC Spanish. 

Your counselors are always available to discuss any questions or concerns. Also, don’t be afraid to talk with your teachers for next year’s classes. They will be able to tell you about their classes’ workloads.
