Elective showcase was a success! It happens every year, where students from all conservatories get to explore the experience of performing on stage. Not only did the students at CSArts love to perform, the crowd loved it too! It was a chance to appreciate that elective classes are great opportunities to learn, and to show what they had been working on all year! Students in non-performing conservatories were able to feel the adrenaline rush of walking on stage–lights flashing, crowds clapping–something they normally wouldn’t do. After the show is completed, students in non-performing conservatories get experience in performing. This showcase gives a chance for students to recognize their growth and achieve an amazing accomplishment after this showcase.

Ms. Winans, a teacher who choreographed the ballet elective classes and helped organize the event says, “Elective classes and teachers really live in their own worlds on campus, so this event gives us the chance as teachers to come together and collaborate with each other.”

Her favorite part of the elective showcase is the dress rehearsal, because the audience gets really lively and supportive, encouraging their friends for the real performance. 

Ballet wasn’t the only class that was shown! There was a variety of hip hop, Taekwondo, stage combat, tap, musical choir, and musical theater! 

Ms. Winans says, “Elective showcase is such a special event. I also love being able to watch what my fellow teachers have choreographed. Every year, I am amazed and inspired by them.”

Not only does it show the hard work of the students, but is also a chance to appreciate the teachers and their dedication to make this an unforgettable event!
