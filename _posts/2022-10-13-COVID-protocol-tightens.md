As fall arrives, so does the return to stricter tracking of Covid on the CSArts Campus. Teachers received an email from the CSArts administration, requiring seating charts for each class in order to track any new outbreaks and give more accurate information for those who may have been exposed to the virus.

Earlier in September, President Joe Biden, in an interview with 60 Minutes, announced that the Covid pandemic was over. However, scientists, doctors, and some students at CSArts aren’t so sure. 

> I don’t think the pandemic is over because it is still affecting people. They are acting like it's over and that is what causes the cases to get worse,” 

Senior Sofia Reyes said. 

> Covid is still a thing and there are still people who aren’t vaccinated.I do not believe that covid will ever be over, but I believe that it will die down,” 

Freshman Leaf Barnett said.  
      
Scientists urge caution in claiming that the Covid pandemic is over. 

> The pandemic is over. If you notice, no one’s wearing masks. Everybody seems to be in pretty good shape.” 

President Biden said. The White House responded that Biden meant to express the fact that vaccines have proved to be useful, and that the virus is now more controlled.

New updated boosters are now available, with Pfizer’s booster being cleared for those 12 and older. Moderna’s vaccine is cleared by the FDA for those 18 and over.
