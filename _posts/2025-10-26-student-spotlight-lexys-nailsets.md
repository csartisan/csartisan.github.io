Calling all glam lovers! If you're looking for a fresh new set of nails, look out for Lexy Nichols, a beginner nail tech and senior here at CSArts. Lexy began her nail journey her freshman year of high school, "I started doing it because it helped me cope in a way," she said. After spending time practicing nails on her friends who appreciated her talents, she discovered her passion for the art form. Lexy has plenty of experience in the fine arts as a visual art student, and being able to apply her artistic skills in her nail business comes in handy!

It may seem difficult to balance school and an after-school business, but Lexy shows that despite the challenge, she is able to persevere with her interests. She said, "The school is very willing to work with me, so I have a good balance and schedule." Living near campus makes her work more accessible to her classmates who can go straight to her house after school and still be able to take the metro home if needed. One of Lexy's past clients--Ocean Van Dam, senior at CSArts--said, "I'm sure anyone would have a good experience with her ... she was really happy to accommodate any adjustments I wanted." Although Ocean had requested a short nail set, Lexy has shown her skill in all kinds of shapes and sizes, "She's really meticulous with her nail art and skilled as well!" he said.

Many students at CSArts enjoy getting their nails done, and Lexy has expressed a desire for clients to begin coming in with more creative ideas. Her favorite trends at the moment are polka dots and 3D sculpted ladybugs and monkeys. She can do many different styles and likes to work with her clients\' preferences. She currently charges \$35-\$50, depending on size and design, and is always looking for new clients.
