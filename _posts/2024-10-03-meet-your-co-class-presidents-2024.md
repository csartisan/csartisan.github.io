While election season in the United States is in full swing, CSArts have already cast their votes and elected co-class presidents. Each grade has two leaders who speak and act for the student body and the CSArtisan spoke with the co-presidents to hear their plans for the year.

Senior Co-Class Presidents Charlie Pokaski and Ivy Kim say they wanted to run in order to make sure the class of 2025 had the best leaders and planners to ensure the best school experiences possible. Senior year is the busiest, as they plan all the important senior events like "senior sunrise," "senior week," and activities surrounding graduation. 

Zakai Haynes and Frankie Fontana are the Junior Co-Class Presidents. They say that the process of running and getting elected was a lot of work, but it paid off.  

> It was an opportunity to help cultivate a positive and unique community,” 

Haynes said. 

Haynes and Fontana want to increase participation and passion from Juniors by adding a class point system for rewards. They also want to focus more on school clubs and encourage collaboration. 

> We believe that clubs are the creative collective of our school,” 

Haynes said.

The Sophomore Co-Class Presidents, Tempele Stewart and Isla Castellon want to set up a student board to gather feedback on certain ideas. 

> There are a few different roles; some are your typical roles like treasurer and a fundraising consultant. But we also have other fun positions like Food Connoisseur, Voice of the Community, and Communicator of the people,” 

Castellon said. Their goal is to increase student involvement to change the school community for the better. 

Evie Linchangco and Kayla Minasian serve as Freshmen Co-Class Presidents. They say their focus is on creating a positive and safe school environment for the Class of 2028.  

> I’ve always aspired to take on leadership roles, and helping others through volunteering. I truly care about creating a school environment that feels like home, where everyone feels seen, valued, and supported. Freshman year is a pivotal time, and I’m eager to help make this transition smoother for all of us,” 

Minasian said. The two are also focused on addressing student concerns, including improvements to lunch lines and are working on creating a Google Form to gather student feedback on various issues. 

> We want to ensure everyone’s voice is heard and that we’re addressing the needs of the students,” 

Linchangco said.
