As the final days of the school year tick by, campus is buzzing with both excitement and emotion. For many students, this time marks the beginning of a bittersweet goodbye to senior friends who have become like family. With graduation only 8 days away, emotions are running high.

Senior Abigail Risdon reflected on her final weeks of high school, saying, “I’m going to miss my time so much here. I’ve made so many amazing friends and so many amazing memories. I truly could not have asked for a better community than the one I’ve found at CSArts.”

Goodbyes are not only difficult for the seniors preparing to walk across the stage, but also for the teachers who have watched them grow.

“It’s exciting and sad to see them go,” said Caballero, a 12th-grade English teacher. “I had my seniors do graduation speeches and as I’ve been reading them I’ve been like, bawling my eyes out. ”

Although many seniors are preparing to move away for college, saying goodbye doesn’t have to mean losing touch. In an age of texts, FaceTime, and social media, staying connected with your friends is easier than ever. Making the effort to check in, plan get-togethers during breaks, or even write the occasional letter can help preserve the friendships that have meant so much.

And while you probably won’t be calling up your teachers, many say they love when former students stop by to visit during breaks or send the occasional update. A quick hello or a thank-you in person can go a long way, and it means more than you might think.

So, as the countdown to graduation continues, take time to enjoy these last moments together and remember that goodbyes don’t have to be final!
