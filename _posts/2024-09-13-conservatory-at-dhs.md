This semester, many Acting and Creative Writing students have made the trek from CSArts to our neighboring campus, Duarte High School during conservatory hours. The main reasons why some conservatory classes are being held at Duarte High is because the teacher-to-student ratio for conservatory classes is not as high as academic classes and the fact that there is not enough room on the CSArts campus for every class to have an individual classroom. When asked why the Acting and Creative Writing conservatories were chosen for this change, Dr. Cook, the Principle of Arts, said:

> The classes for this fall semester for these two conservatories have limited needs in terms of specific types of classrooms, like dance studios or music rehearsal spaces. They also do not need specific types of equipment for their classes, other than computers, like Production & Design.‚Äù 

Dr. Cook also said that this will continue for future semesters.
