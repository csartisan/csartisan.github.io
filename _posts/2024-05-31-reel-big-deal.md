You might have heard about the new Film/TV Industry program being introduced for the 2024-2025 school year. When I spoke with Dr. Cook, he clarified that it is less of a standalone conservatory and more of an integrated program, offering classes of which all conservatories can participate. For example, Creative Writing conservatory students might take a TV writing or broadcast news class, while Instrumental Music students could enroll in a composition-in-film class. Additionally, there will be elective classes available during the academic day, allowing students from any conservatory to explore film industry-related subjects.

This exciting development is made possible by a grant that CSArts-SGV recently won and is part of an “industry readiness” program. The grant has not only funded the new Film/TV Industry program but has also enabled the introduction of a new E-Sports computer science class and the remodeling of Mr. Read's classroom. Keep an eye out for these new classes in 2025!
