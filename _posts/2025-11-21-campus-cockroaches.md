In October, roaches infested some classrooms and areas on campus, leaving many students with creepy-crawly feelings.

The roaches were mostly around the 200s, the Quad, and the cafeteria. Principal of Academics Nicole Read said that the rain and then the pipe burst probably "forced" them out of underground plumbing.

Exterminators spray insecticide on campus once every few weeks. Last month, they sprayed several times in one week. "They did it over three small doses," Ms. Read said. "We have to be careful not to overdo it in order to protect our students since insecticides can be powerful chemical agents." The school also has to follow state environmental restrictions for pesticides.

Cockroaches are not aggressive. "While cockroaches can certainly be gross and scary, they will not hurt you," said Ms. Read. However, an infestation of roaches can cause harm. According to the EPA, (Environmental Protection Agency), roaches can trigger asthma attacks or carry bacteria like [salmonella, staphylococcus and streptococcus.]{.mark}

Ms. Read encourages students to keep reporting the roaches to administration.
