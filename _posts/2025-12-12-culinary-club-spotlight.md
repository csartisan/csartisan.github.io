Instead of spending lots ordering takeout every night, head to the Culinary Club to learn some cooking skills and simple recipes that taste great and can save you money. The club meets every blue Tuesday in room 400, which is behind all the other 400s classrooms by the bathrooms.

In the Culinary Club, students practice cooking skills to make various recipes, such as Miso soup. They also practice techniques like slicing fruit in order to make a fruit salad that looks as good as it tastes. In future, the club plans to make dishes like mashed potatoes, cucumber salad, and soft-boiled eggs.

The student leader of the club is Akira Mueller, a Senior. He said that his motivation for starting Culinary Club was, "actually my dad's idea. I noticed a lot of my friends really just didn't know how to cook and he thought it would be fun for me to make a club from this and teach people some cooking basics."

Mueller chose to work with his sponsor teacher, Mr. Mohamed, because he's his TA, and he figured it would be easy to set up since he has his class before lunch on blue days.

Freshman Irene Thomas joined the culinary club because of her enjoyment of cooking, saying, "Because I really like cooking and I wanted to be able to join a club so I could expand on my skills and learn more."

Thomas expanded more on how she feels actively partaking in the club when she said, "my culinary experience has been great so far, and I'm excited to try new recipes, and work with others."

So, head to room 400 during blue Tuesdays to cook some tasty dishes with the Culinary Club!
