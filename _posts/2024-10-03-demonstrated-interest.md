As we ease into the school year and application season approaches, one term keeps coming up: “demonstrated interest.” Understanding how to effectively showcase your best qualities for prospective schools could be the key to standing out.

“Demonstrated interest” is defined as “the effort a student makes through their college application and actions showing a genuine interest in a specific school.” In other words, you’re letting the college know the likelihood that you will enroll if accepted. This may include attending college fairs, visiting the campus, emailing admissions officers, applying for early decision, and even connecting on social media. 

While “demonstrated Interest” is not as important as a stellar transcript and strong leadership, it can be the icing on the cake. 

> We don’t consider demonstrated interest when looking at applications but it can still be a great way to learn about the prospective school and see if it is a good fit,” 

University of California Santa Barbara representative said. Other schools, however, do factor in “demonstrated interest” when making admissions decisions.

The CSArtisan has compiled a list of schools and the degree of importance of “demonstrated interest.” If you are interested in a school that is not on the list, see your counselor for more details.
