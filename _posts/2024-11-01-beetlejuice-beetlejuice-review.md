Fans of the 1988 classic Beetlejuice have been awaiting its remake, and Beetlejuice Beetlejuice  does not disappoint. Directed by Tim Burton, the film brings back most of the beloved characters while introducing new faces that keep the spooky charm alive.

The Original Beetlejuice is an academy award winning musical film, and one of Tim Burton’s more famously known films. The new film supplies new music and introduces Jenna Ortega to the comical crew including Winona Ryder, Kathleen O’Harra, and  Michael Keaton. Beetlejuice Beetlejuice explores the idea of afterlife, with alluringly written music and costuming, and sets.  The film explores themes of family, loss, grief, and the passage of time. It reflects on how we confront our pasts and how those experiences shape our identities now.

Tim Burton’s signature aesthetic projected spookily throughout the film. The authentic, lime-green and dark purple colors, gothic designs, and whimsical, chilling atmosphere, transported viewers once again to the world of eerie afterlife. Burton’s flair of fusing humor with horror remains intact, ensuring that audiences are both entertained and slightly spooked, crafting imaginative scenes that balance the film’s darker themes, heartfelt moments and lighthearted moments. This fusion of emotions resonated deeply with this critic, making it more than just a spooky comedy to watch during fall. 

This film definitely did not let down the original fans, and definitely brought some new ones, making it one of the biggest releases this year..
