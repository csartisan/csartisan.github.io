You wake up on Monday with one question on your mind: is it a Blue or Gold Day? Keeping track of whether to go to blocks 1-3, or 4-6 can be that one last stressor of the morning.

After 3 years of the struggle, Ada Schmidt (CW '25) created a solution to the “Blue Day/Gold Day” problem and created “CSArts Pocket Calendar.” It’s a handy app on your phone which tells you the day’s color. The app is downloadable on the app store on Apple, and Ada is currently working on bringing it to the Android store with the help of Computer Science and English Teacher, Jake Read. 

“I finished the Intro Computer Science program early, and Mr. Read suggested I use my time in the class to develop an app that would show what color day it is,” Schmidt said.  

In regards to the challenges, Mr. Read said, “I think the hardest thing is to find the problem to solve, or the concept.” Ada said her toughest challenges were with the genuine code. “I didn't know any Javascript (which is what I used to code the app) so I had to teach myself little by little. It was actually a really helpful learning tactic!” 

The app is free, and to all Android users: the CSArtisan will let you know when it is available for you. 

iOS users can use the app by downloading it on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/csarts-pocket-calendar/id6738809787).
