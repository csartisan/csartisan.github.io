On April 13th, CSArts Seniors and Juniors in Taekwondo competed in the annual Taekwondo black belt test at OCSA! After two months of intense training all students who participated succeeded in getting their black belts!

The rigorous test took all day, and measured endurance, strength, combat prowess, and memorization. The day before the test, younger Taekwondo students wrote letters of encouragement to their Junior or Senior of choice. According to Master Foyle, students shed some tears, showing just how much peer support means to them. 

Taekwondo is a Korean martial art that specializes in kicks and forms called “Poomsae.” In Taekwondo, students learn how to kick, strike, submit, and grapple. These are then put to use in the “sparring sessions” or training drills. If you want a good workout, while also learning discipline and self-defense, give it a try next Fall!

This isn’t the end of the road for the Taekwondo students. On the afternoon and evening of May 11th, students of all grades in Taekwondo will hold a performance at the PAC. They are rehearsing diligently for a show of strength, discipline, and motion ( along with some awesome music too)! If you have any questions, you can contact Mr. Foyle.
