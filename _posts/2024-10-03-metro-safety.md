Every day, large numbers of CSArts students rely on the Metro to get to and from school. Many students are aware of the possible dangers that riding the metro may present, as crime incidents on LA Metro have increased over the years along with the number of riders. 

> So far this year, there have been 2.18 crimes per 100,000 riders, compared to 1.2 at this time in 2021 and 0.84 in 2019,” 

said Jenna Peterson from Cal Matters.

LA Metro has responded to the increase in crime on its trains and platforms in major ways. They have increased the amount of cameras and lights in and around trains. Cameras are used to ward off any criminals and keep track of any active criminal activities. Studies show that just by seeing cameras’ presence, many criminals are deterred and don’t go through with their plans.

Better visibility is a great resource, especially on a ride back home at night. Because of that, lots more lighting was added in. This is important for students as we lose more daylight and for the elderly population as the tracks and platforms are better lit.

In addition to partnering with local law enforcement agencies, LA Metro has also hired more well-trained security guards to patrol the trains and be on the lookout for dangerous incidents. Metro has also hired more “ambassadors,” who are there to assist those who need physical assistance and are able to report suspicious activity.

Another concern is the rise of unhoused people in the Los Angeles area who face mental health issues and who also rely on the Metro. In response, LA Metro created the Metro Homeless Outreach team, which was made by partnering with the Los Angeles Department of Health Services. Those who are a part of the team are set up at different locations to provide essential resources to people experiencing homelessness on the Metro system. 

These implementations are hoped to immediately increase rider safety.  LA Metro is also looking toward the future with its “Vision Plan,” which is set to be finished by 2028 for the upcoming LA Summer Olympics. While exact details of the plan have not yet been released,  Metro’s Vision 2028 released a statement about their project that hopes to: "provide high-quality mobility options that enable people to spend less time traveling; deliver outstanding trip experiences for all users of the transportation system; enhance communities and lives through mobility and access to opportunity; transform LA County through regional collaboration and national leadership; and provide responsive, accountable, and trustworthy governance within the Metro organization."

It is important for students who ride Metro to be aware of their surroundings and it is never a bad idea to travel with another student. If you have any questions about Metro  safety, you can contact Assistant Principal, Leon Metoyer, or Metro Community Relations Officer Daniel Gonzalez.   

It’s also a good idea to save these important numbers in your phone:
