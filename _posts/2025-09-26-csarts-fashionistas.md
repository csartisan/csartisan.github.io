Many students at CSArts use their artistic skills every morning when deciding their outfit of the day. Ranging from baggy pants to rainbow jewelry, fashion is used as a creative outlet. As the years go by, different style crazes pass, and students experiment with new clothing and accessories. But how do they keep true to their personal taste while exploring trends? Representing your voice through your physical appearance is a journey that can take a while and looks different for everyone.

Fashion within students at CSArts is very diverse, with some taking inspiration from different decades, different cultures, and even from TV shows. Winston Rabon, a CSArts senior, claims to get inspiration from the 70s and 90s, “I kind of mix it sometimes; some days I wear flared jeans and some days I wear baggy.” Winston agrees that his style resonates with how he perceives himself. Some of his favorite articles include boots, flared jeans, and tank tops. With the significance of music during the 70s and 90s, it is no surprise that this popular music student finds himself taking after them in his daily outfits.

A very colorful japanese style called Decora is “ inspired by childhood, bright colors, children's shows, and toys,” said Temple Stewart, a junior at CSArts who says she gets her outfit inspirations from the Decora style .  She wears lots of colorful beaded jewelry with toys and rainbow leg warmers among many other unique and vibrant accessories. Temple describes her style as “colorful, fun, and joyous,” expressing positivity with only her clothing.

Besides international and historical influences, some students compare their style to TV show characters. 2000’s media seem to hold inspiration for many students, with Y2K making a comeback in the fashion space. “I feel like I dress like Lorelai Gilmore,” said Lucy Hunt, a senior, in reference to the TV Drama from the 2000s, Gilmore Girls. Lucy says that she likes to spice up her outfits with jewelry, scarves, and even just with her hair! 

Overall, fashion ranges from person to person, oftentimes reflecting their personalities. CSArts is a school where students with different styles can thrive in the diverse fashion culture.. When it comes to school attire, there is no such thing as over or underdressed, and creativity is always encouraged!
