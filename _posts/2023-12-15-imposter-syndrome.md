Going to a school such as CSArts, it's easy to get caught up in all the people around you. With so much talent and skill, some people find it difficult to focus on their own strengths and may begin to feel that they haven’t really earned the things they’ve accomplished. Well, you may have heard of the phenomenon of impostor syndrome. In short, having impostor syndrome is characterized by doubts or failing to believe that you earned something or achieved something on your own account such as being skilled in a certain subject or being exceptionally smart. It’s very clear how this could apply to the mindset of some artists. It’s not uncommon to know someone who may be experiencing this or even experiencing impostor syndrome yourself!

It is believed that this feeling stems from how we, as humans, perceive ourselves vs. others. It is natural to be aware of one's own perceived flaws or shortcomings, but that’s ultimately what makes us human. Signs of impostor syndrome can be found in a variety of people from all sorts of backgrounds. 

Seeing the sometimes idealized appearance of others can cause one to doubt their own abilities as they focus on the performances of these other people, not seeing the effort they may have put into something. Being around so many amazing artists could bring forth these feelings.

> I always felt like my art wasn't good enough and that I could never be as good as the people around me,” 

said Sara Tran (VA ‘26).

Even while being incredibly skilled, some still feel that they aren’t enough. This is totally okay!

Despite being so prevalent, it can be difficult to talk about impostor syndrome given how personal it is. But, it is believed that talking about it or hearing that others feel similar can help a lot. It’s important to be supportive of others that may be struggling with these thoughts or to find someone to talk to if you feel this way too. It’s normal to doubt yourself but it's important to remember what you have accomplished!
