Have you seen all the packets of carrots and apples all over the ground? On March 14, the lunch and security staff added cardboard boxes near some trash cans. In the cafeteria where most students eat, a cardboard box for recycling has been placed by the door. These receptacles were added by the administration to help with the litter problem of unwanted food from students all over campus.

With the recent rise of the amount of trash around campus, some students have complained about how this is causing more work for the  custodial staff. There have been problems with students leaving their trash out because of the trash cans being full; however, there are always more crash cans if students sought them out. It’s a reminder that littering doesn’t just affect students, it also affects other humans and  animals on campus.

On windy days, trash around campus tends to put animals in danger. The recent add-up of tree branches, trash, and water from the wind, usually ends up in rivers like on the way to CSArts. Some reservoirs around town are filled with leaves and trash, affecting the birds and animals that might be living in those areas. Birds tend to use branches and other materials to make their nests, but sometimes they can harm them. 

CSArts’ custodial staff JJ and Alex do more than their fair share of hours, helping out with setting up school-wide events and more! 

> One thing we’ve discussed but never tried here on campus that they do at our sister school OCSA did… was a system where the first 10 minutes of Block 3 or 6 classrooms had to do trash duty and it would rotate, so a teacher twice a year would have a class that got trash duty,” 

said Assistant Principal Nicole Read. 

With an administrator mentioning this solution, students have a choice: pick up your trash each day, or you may not have a choice but to have you and your class pick up trash like the program at OCSA.
