In October 2024, DC introduced a new series called the Absolute Universe written by Scott Snyder. This universe takes the stories of the classic heroes we know and love, and flips them right on their back. Following the death of Darkseid in DC All In, the "Elseworld" or the "Alpha World" was formed from the despair and negative energy that he released. This directly opposes the main world, Earth 0, which contains hope and justice at its core. Darkseid's soul cursed the Elseworld, giving the usual characters in DC different stories.

Absolute Batman, for one, isn't rich like in the original universe. Instead, he's a lower class man depicted with multiple different jobs, one of which being a construction worker. This reimagination highlights the intelligence of Bruce Wayne by showing his capabilities in different circumstances and not just when he's wealthy. When he was a child, his dad was killed in a shooting at the Gotham zoo, leaving his mom as a single mother and taking away from the \"nothing to lose" aspect of the original Batman.

Another example is Absolute Superman, who instead of being sent to Earth as a baby, was sent to Earth as a young boy. Kal-el's connection to Krypton separates him from the human aspect of the original Superman, creating the biggest difference between the two: a lack of his alter-ego Clark Kent. Kal-el is guided by his suit which contains Kryptonian artificial intelligence, and actively seeks perpetrators of social injustice and oppression parallel to his parents' past efforts to save Krypton from corruption. This Superman is in his teens, making the change from Krypton to Earth more recent and causing him to be much more angry and emotional than the original.

Superman enthusiast Noah Johnson, who is an Integrated Arts senior at CSArts, expresses how he's yet to read Absolute Superman due to hesitance over the major changes. Although a fan of Superman and the Absolute series altogether, he shares a concern on the adaptations of the character and says, "I still prefer normal Superman because of what he symbolizes". Nevertheless, Noah approves of the new storylines saying, "Whoever is coming up with this stuff deserves a raise." Another senior at CSArts, Kayden Hicks, also shows an appreciation for the differences in the Absolute series. "I think it's the most creative thing they've done in a couple years," he says, "there's been many spins on characters like Batman, but this one feels special." Kayden highly recommends Absolute Batman, and says that despite his preference in the Marvel universe, it piqued his interest.

There are many more characters depicted in the Absolute series from heroes to villains. Other popular favorites include Absolute Wonder Woman, Absolute Flash, and Absolute Martian Manhunter. DC fan or not, this series is a gamechanger from the well-known narratives and could be a good read for any superhero fans.
