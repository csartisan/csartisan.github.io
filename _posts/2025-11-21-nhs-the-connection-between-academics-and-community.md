The National Honors Society is a great way to spice up a college application while holding up the core pillars of CSArts. Applicants have learned whether or not they got in last month, and are beginning to add to their service hours.

NHS focuses on its pillars: *Leadership*, exemplified through taking opportunities. Service, exemplified by the 25 service hours that members complete each semester, *Character*, demonstrated by following CSArt's core pillars, finally *Scholarship*, shown by maintaining a GPA of at least 3.5 GPA.

As for the service hours, many members are part of separate clubs that provide opportunities for service, and the monthly meetings allow members to organize large projects. Michael Turf, the teacher in charge of NHS, also has recommendations about where you can find service hours. "One of the most popular ways students obtain service hours is by peer tutoring. Students work alongside teachers during office hours in tutoring and that counts towards the service hours," Mr. Turf also recommends using [[Interview.org]{.underline}](http://interview.org) to find service opportunities in your area. You can also work through certain conservatories.

Service hours aren't just for NHS students either. You or anyone you know can collect service hours for college applications. For more information about NHS, check [[nationalhonorssociety.org]{.underline}](http://nationalhonorssociety.org)
