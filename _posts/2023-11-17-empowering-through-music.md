Have you heard of the Dragon Kim Music Foundation? It’s a program rooted at CSArts and Orange County School of The Arts named after a student and breaking down barriers hindering aspiring young musicians from pursuing their dreams.

In 2015, the Dragon Kim Music Foundation embarked on a melodious journey, one that would change students’ lives and to provide instruments and top-notch music education without financial constraints.

In January 2016, DKMF launched its music program with just 14 enthusiastic kids. Fast forward to today, it has orchestrated a profound impact. The foundation has planted its roots at Orange County School of the Arts and California School of the Arts, harmonizing diverse communities with the universal language of music. As of now, there are 164 student teachers, 115 instruments, 183 free lessons, and 413 participants. The Foundation hopes to expand even more to make sure that all students, regardless of background or circumstance, has the opportunity to explore the exciting world of music.

Mea Ji, DKMF volunteer of the Recorder program said, 

> Joining the foundation’s music program made me find a place where young hearts and talents flourish.”

During each session, teachers expose their students to various musical forms such as band, orchestra, guitar, and choir. Every class brings something great to their minds, with students always leaving the classroom full of joy and excitement!

The foundation has become a platform for high schoolers to not only enhance their musical ability, but also to nurture a community where the passion for music is shared and appreciated.

Grace Botero, DKMF volunteer of the General Music program said, 

> Teaching the kids is really the highlight of my day. I always enjoy seeing them have fun learning and playing music.

The harmonious notes of their success reverberate through the lives touched by the Dragon Kim Music Foundation, creating a symphony of opportunity, passion, and happiness.
