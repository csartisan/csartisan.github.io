#### Dive Into the Magic: Unleash Your Inner Mermaid

The grand room of the Centre in Lakewood greeted students for Winter Formal with sparkling decorations, music pumping, the soft glow of lights as students grew their sea legs for the “Meet Me at the Mermaid Lagoon" party! No one wore fins to the dance on February 3rd; however, the room was a sea of elegant gowns and dapper suits, and there even was a group of Pirates! 

Students danced, stood in long lines to get pictures in the photo booth. The silliest pictures and cutest moments have been captured. Not just in their hearts, but with photos documenting their formal for the Winter “Sea-son.” 

The students of CSArts nominated their peers that they thought should be crowned for the Winter Formal Court. Congratulations to Sofia Thompson and Kiana Alverez! And thank you to CSArts Leadership for an amazing night!
