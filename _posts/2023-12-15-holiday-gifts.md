Don’t have any ideas for what to get your friends and families for the holidays?  Don’t worry, because we have special gifts handmade by our fellow CSArts students! These creative students have fun items that will lift the stress of finding good gifts for your loved ones.

Matilda Currie, a 9th grader in Visual Arts has a business called “Skydesign,” selling keychains, earrings, rings, and necklaces. She says she loves incorporating bright and bold colors, resulting in beautiful colorful accessories, perfect for anyone. You can find her selling these on Instagram [@skydesign____](https://www.instagram.com/skydesign____/?hl=en). 

Two friends, Juniors, Linhlyl Harwell and Sophia Teyolia, started a crochet business together. They both always enjoyed crocheting, and so they decided to start their own business. Some things they sell are crochet tops, tote bags, keychains, and overall more crochet accessories. Commissions are open during the holiday season, so make sure to visit their Instagram [@doubletreble.co](https://www.instagram.com/doubletreble.co/).

Juliet Martinez in 11th grade has always loved to crochet. She sells crochet earrings, room decor (crochet garlands), and tote bags. She is planning on posting more for her business, especially with the holidays coming up. You can find her business on Instagram [@crochet.crafts.by.juliet](https://www.instagram.com/crochet.crafts.by.juliet/).

If you have a student-run business, contact the CSArtisan, so we can pass on the information!
