It's officially the season where Junior and Seniors are  scrambling to win scholarships. There are all kinds of scholarships out there so what you submit to one place might be different for another. For example, one might ask for an essay, another could ask for an application, resume, letter of recommendation, transcripts or even a portfolio/video submission. It all depends on what you are applying for.

The number of websites you can use in order to apply are endless, however, counselor Emily Christy recommends you use trusted websites like “Fastweb,” “BigFuture Scholarships,” and “Scholarships.com.” While on your search for scholarships, Mrs. Christy emphasizes the gravity of being safe while applying for scholarships and to watch out for potential scams. A telltale sign of a scam are websites that require you to pay a fee to apply. During the process of application, Mrs. Christy suggests carefully following the instructions. “To learn how to apply for a scholarship, go to the scholarship's website or application portal, follow the instructions carefully and make sure to submit by the deadline,” Christy explains.

Picking a scholarship that matches your profile is equally as important. “It's helpful to choose a scholarship that aligns with your strengths, interests or background. For example, if you love the arts, apply for some art-based scholarships. If you love math or science, apply for some STEM related scholarships,” Christy said.

In addition to interests and academics, consider ones that focus on personal development, hobbies, culture, and community involvement. By using your passions and achievements your chances of winning the scholarship is higher.

All in all, focus on finding opportunities which align with you for a better chance at success and be vigilant to avoid scams. Scholarships are a valuable resource which can only benefit you in the long run for your journey into college.
