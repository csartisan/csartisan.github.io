October and September are very significant times for the Hispanic community, as Hispanic Heritage Month begins. Here at CSArts, many people are getting involved in celebrating Hispanic culture. The Latinx Unidxs con Honor y Amistad club, (LUCHA) has sold paletas, a Hispanic treat, during lunch, and have even shared influential figures on their very own feature in the morning announcements, called "The Latinx Factor!"

The club plans to host more events, like lotería games during lunch. “LUCHA was honored to play a part in representing the Latinx community within CSArts during Hispanic Heritage Month. We believe it was an amazing way of representing and sharing our culture with our peers," said LUCHA Club Historian and Fundraising team member, Kayla Santamaria (VA ‘23).

Other clubs have also been sharing the diversity of Hispanic culture through food. The Pretty Sweets Club sold delicious Hispanic pastries from all over Latin America as well, such as cups of virgin coquito, pan dulce, sorullos, and homemade buñuelos.

The Spanish language classes on campus have also been learning about the different Hispanic cultures, and made a periodic table that included information about famous Hispanic individuals, displayed in the cafeteria. “I personally enjoyed the assignment. It was cool learning about the traditions, historical, and the geographical aspects of Hispanic Heritage Month,” student Ivy Kim said (VA ‘25). 

It doesn’t end there! The World Language department also hosted a film festival that showcased “Selena,” a film that tells the story of Selena Quintanilla's life and the challenges she experienced as a Latina. 

Students have also taken action on social media to spread awareness and appreciation towards the Hispanic community. “I’ve seen people online doing things on the streets that are celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month. I have also seen many people online spreading resources to help hispanics and I have also participated in this through my social media platforms in the past,” said Alexa Vazquez (VA ’25). At CSArts, Hispanic culture truly has the opportunity to be celebrated and shared with all through any way possible!
