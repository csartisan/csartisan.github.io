For students who have been here a year or more, this school year has felt a bit different. Even the smallest change in the bell schedule has caused confusion. But the changes were ultimately made with student safety in mind.	

The decision came after feedback from parents, students, and different groups. The WASC Committee, Safety Committee, and Executive Leadership also gave important input. The result? Nutrition was shortened by 2 minutes, lunch by 5 minutes, and an earlier end time to the academic and conservatory day. Still, lunches are longer at CSArts compared to most other schools. 

Other times changes affected conservatory classes (blocks 7 and 8). Both blocks were shortened by 5 minutes. Office hours were lengthened by 5 minutes. That gives students more time to work with teachers after class.

With all these changes, the school day ends 15 minutes earlier than last school year. This means that students using the metro will be able to get out earlier while there is still daylight. 

“All those extra minutes are hopefully helping students achieve more healthy life balance, less stress, and maybe even more sleep,” said Academic Principal Nicole Read. The shortened day also helps the school financially, due to a dip in parent donations.
