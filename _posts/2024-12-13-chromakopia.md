With all the hype around Chromakopia, Tyler, The Creator’s newest album, I’ve been excited to check it out. The album was released on Oct 28, 2024 to its eager fansbase. But, does the album deliver?

I would say yes! Song after song was different: “Balloon”, “Sticky” and “Rah Tah Tah” have energetic scream-worthy beats along with slower, more emotional songs like “Hey Jane”, “I Hope You Find Your Way Home,” and “Judge Judy.”

Song after song has been added to my playlist, but “Balloon”, “Sticky” and “Rah Tah Tah” have been my favorites from the beginning. I love the playful and comedic lyrics of the first two, and the dramatic melodies in the background of all three catch my attention. In my opinion, other songs, especially “Judge Judy” have been a lot less impressive and exciting.

The poll included CSArts' favorite and least favorite Chromakopia song, and rating of the album. So far, “Sticky” appears to be the most liked song, and “Judge Judy” is the least favorite.

“The change in St. Chroma from the trailer to the official song actually made it worse,” said student Plaid Brake. Student Jaxon Jackson said, “Judge Judy is not all that. If I were to rank it in comparison to every Tyler song I've ever heard, it would be near the bottom.”

The album got an 8 out of 10 overall.
