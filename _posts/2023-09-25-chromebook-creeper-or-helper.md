As schools begin to embrace the digital age, teachers find their own ways to combat distractions and make sure students stay on task.

Imagine, you’re sitting in your English class, writing a long, tedious essay. Leaning back in your chair, you stifle a groan. You feel you’ve worked hard for a solid 30 minutes, and deserve a break. You glance towards your teacher who seems to be paying no mind to what you’re doing, too engrossed in their own matters. You move your cursor across the tabs, switching to one you feel will offer more entertainment, but before you can truly engage with it, you're met once again with your English essay. Looking back at your teacher, they peer at you with a cunning glare. You know then, with absolute certainty this is none other than the work of GoGuardian. 

As of the 2023 school year, CSArts has decided to implement GoGuardian into the classroom. GoGuardian is an educational technology company that allows teachers to monitor their students' online activity, filter content, and alert school officials of threatening (either to self or other) behaviors on the district owned chromebooks. It is primarily used as a monitoring service to help students stay focused and engaged with their classroom tasks. 

Michael Turf, a history teacher at CSArts welcomes the new system into his classroom this year.

> It's a brand-new system that the school is using and a bit of an adjustment period, but I am happy the school is investing in programs that support students and teachers in the classroom.”

> GoGuardian was brought on board to help with staying focused and provide students with some focus and guidance from these distractive behaviors. Especially teaching AP classes, classroom time is extremely valuable, and GoGuardian allows me to monitor student computer behaviors and provide interventions throughout class time. GoGuardian provides a platform for me to intervene without calling attention to a specific student in front of the Class, ” 

said Turf.

A student in Ms. Nelson’s class also agrees that GoGuardian can be helpful. 

> The only teacher that I have that uses it is my Spanish teacher. She uses it all the time so I  think she likes it. I don't really mind it. It keeps me on track and forces me to do my work.”

### Not Everyone Is A Fan

While monitoring all students' screens may make it easier for teachers to intervene, is constant supervision the best route to take? While teachers do think that it is helpful for classroom control, students might not like the idea of being monitored for doing their work.

> I think it can enhance classroom productivity,” 

Emma Thompson, an English teacher who decided not to use the monitoring application says, 

> but it can also create tension in a classroom.“ 

Students had different opinions on the use of GoGuardian. 

> It used to bother me (especially in elementary school) when I would want to play online games instead of working in class,” 

One student said. 

> But now I have to admit it's good for staying on task and preventing people from cheating during tests,” 

said one anonymous student. Another student argues that it causes them stress in class, disrupting their work time.  

> Sometimes I feel like I have to pretend that I’m doing my work even though I’m actually doing my work.”
