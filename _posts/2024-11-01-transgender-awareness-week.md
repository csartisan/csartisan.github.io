Transgender people are more than four times more likely than cisgender people to be violently attacked, according to a study by UCLA Williams Institute School of Law. Transgender Awareness Week is observed from November 13th to the 19th. The week is meant as a time to remember those suffering from transphobic violence, and a time to appreciate the rich history of trans people.

Social Sciences teacher Micahel Turf, is the advisor of CSArts’ SAGA club (sexuality and gender alliance). Turf is also earning his Masters in History with an emphasis on black and queer American history, including trans people of color.  

“Appreciating the trans community [...] allows us to honor the courage, resilience, and contributions of individuals who challenge societal norms and live authentically.” Mr. Turf says. “Trans people, especially from marginalized racial and ethnic groups, like Black trans women, face extraordinary systematic challenges yet continue to shape culture, politics, and justice movements.”
	
A famous example of this movement, Turf says, is Stonewall. Fighting for their rights, a large group of trans and black women protested against the inequality of the LGBTQ+ community. Marsha P. Johnson, a trans and Black woman, sparked the Stonewall protests in 1969. The 1980’s  HIV/AIDS crisis complicated issues for the queer community even more. During the struggle, Black and trans women supported those diagnosed from within the community and fought for treatment and a cure.

In 2024, 664 anti-trans bills have been introduced across the country, according to Trans Legislation Tracker.  The struggle for awareness of laws and violence in the LGBTQ+ community, and specifically the trans community is why advocates created a week of awareness. Groups like SAGA at CSArts continue to provide education, support and a safe space for LGBTQ+ people. If you would like more information on SAGA, contact Mr. Turf in room 208.  If you are in crisis, you can contact The Trevor Project Crisis Line to talk or text at 866-488-7386.
