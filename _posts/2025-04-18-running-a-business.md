As a student, running a business can seem intimidating, but there are many ways it can benefit you! Navigating your business correctly and balancing your school life is key.

Running a small business can give you valuable skills for your future, including career experience. Choosing something that you are passionate about helps make the process more enjoyable for you, and feel less like work. You could sell handmade jewelry, pottery, baked goods, or have a tutoring business. 

Balancing school work and a small business can be tough, but not impossible. One of the beauties of having your own business is flexibility. Making your jewelry, for example, during weeks when your school workload isn’t as heavy, and then having drops during certain dates is an idea that could help you. “I get to sell it whenever I want,” says a junior at CSArts who sells pottery. “There’s no pressure, and it works with my own schedule.” 

Of course, coming up with a plan is always important for your business, but this doesn’t have to be complicated. Simply outlining your goals and marketing approaches can be enough. From there, social media is a good place to promote your business. 

Marall Tahanian, a student at CSArts had a small business, where she handmade paper blossoms to sell. 

“It helped me develop business skills that I can use in the future!” she says.

She has made her own website and found that it works best with her schedule to run her business during the summer.

“Some advice I have for other students when it comes to your own business is to not be afraid to promote your business, and that it’s okay to ask for help,” she says. 

As your business grows, you will learn valuable lessons, embrace challenges, and gain new skills that will help you in your future.
