Jaywalking is legal in California, but it’s not always safe. Many students cross Central Ave. in the midst of traffic, or at street corners without a crossing guard. 

Jessica Pang takes the Metro after school. “I see students running across that road all the time,” she said. 

Students run to reach their parents’ cars on the opposite side of Central. Principal of Academics, Nicole Read, “Students and parents should not be doing or allowing this.” She recommends that parents park on the CSArts side of Central, or on Evergreen Street (east of the 210 and next to the route students take to the Metro station). At the very least, cross at the street corner. 

At the Highland-Central corner though, there’s another problem: crossing guards have been late or missing until recently. “Sometimes there’s not a crossing guard, and I just have to rely on the stop light,” Jessica said.

Ms. Read explained that there was a staffing shortage. “One of our crossing guards has had a series of illnesses and car trouble that has prevented them from getting to school on time,” she said.

The school can’t put a crosswalk in front of the lobby because of traffic laws, so take the extra walk to one, then cross the street.
