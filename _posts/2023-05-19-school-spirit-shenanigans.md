From our haunting Halloweens to our crazy contests, there’s no denying that at CSArts, festivities are beyond fantastic. As we approach the end of the school year, there’s no better time than the present to reflect on the spirited shenanigans that CSArts gets up to when spirit days roll around.

Halloween this year, as always, transformed our beloved campus into a perfectly spooky-themed hauntfest! With a wide assortment of spooky and hilarious costumes, it’s safe to say that CSArts goes above and beyond for Halloween.
