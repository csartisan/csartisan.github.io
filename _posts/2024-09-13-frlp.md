The Free and Reduced Lunch Program, or the FRLP for short, is an enrollment that makes certain students eligible for one free lunch and one breakfast meal daily. Among free meals you can also benefit from:

- Free lockers
- Free parking permits
- Free student planners
- Reduced price for yearbooks, field trips, and tickets to student dances.

Are you eligible for the Free and Reduced Lunch Program?
You can check using these steps:

1. Visit the [CSArts website](https://sgv.csarts.net).
2. On the sidebar, you will see a link titled “student services.” Clicking it will open up a list of options to select.
3. Scroll down and select “Free and Reduced Lunch Program.”
4. From there you will see a link to the SchoolCafe website. Once you click on the link please create an account if you don't already have an existing one.
5. Finally, there will be a quick survey for parents/guardians to fill out for Duarte Unified to verify if your family qualifies for a FRLP status. Your family must submit a CSArts-SGV FRLP annually in order to still qualify.

If you have any questions, see your counselor for more details.
