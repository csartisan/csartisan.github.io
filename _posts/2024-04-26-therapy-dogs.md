Stress from the testing week is finally over, but more stress is on the way! It is important for students to take breaks from their studies as we get closer to the end of the school year, and find moments to relax. CSArts helps by giving free ice cream with the opportunity to hang out with therapy dogs after classes on Friday, April 12th. 

> I really enjoyed the event, it was a great way to destress and end the state testing week on a good note. Thank you CSArts!

Freshman Karina Yue said.

> I personally really enjoyed that it was free because it gave all students an opportunity to destress without having to worry about bringing cash, afford it, or anything,” 

Luna Nyguen said.

> The event was really fun for me because I got to play with a bunch of dogs- there were only three, which was a little disappointing… but I still did get to play with them, and see their cuteness,” 

Julian Torres said.

> It was really helpful because, after the testing week, I was feeling very tired and stressed, but then the dogs and ice cream helped me and made me happier.” 

Mariani Ogata noted.	

The “End of Testing Week Celebration” was sponsored by CSArts Leadership. The event reminded students and staff how important it is to take care of our overall well-being at school. Here’s to creating a school community where every student’s success and happiness are top priority!
