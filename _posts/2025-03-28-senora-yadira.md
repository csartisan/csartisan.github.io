This year marks the end of an era in CSArts’ in the World Languages Department. After 8 years of teaching Spanish at CSArts, Sra. Yadira Rivera shared with her students that this is her last semester. Rivera says her retirement is bittersweet. She loves being with students, and “chismeando” (Spanish for “gossiping”) with them. Even through all of the tedious grading, she finds joy in teaching and says it is rewarding to reunite with past students who remember and thank her for her sweet and generous character.

Rivera will be making a big move in the months ahead. She will be returning to her homeland, Puerto Rico. Her retirement plans include spending time with her family and traveling around the world. Her first stop after Puerto Rico? Ireland! Then it’s off to a fourteen-day cruise to Iceland, and a week in France. After she’s done vacationing around the world, she plans on fulfilling a life-long dream of living in Spain for a year. Thank you for your dedication, support, and heart Sra. Rivera! We will miss you!
