There aren’t enough hours in the day for CSArts-SGV students. The combined workload of academic and conservatory classes at CSArts are hard to manage and sometimes make sleep a luxury. That’s why students have access to the many support systems available to aid in their successes.

“Our counselors are our first line of support for students, as they are trained in college counseling, career counseling, as well as social and emotional counseling,” said Principal of Arts, Dr. Stephen Cook. He also mentioned that CSArts specialist in restorative practices, Dr. Heather Williams, is available to help students manage stress and any conflicts that may arise. 

As students move from one grade to the next, the challenges and personal responsibilities increase. Principal of Academics, Mrs. Read recommends holding yourself accountable as a strategy for maintaining strong grades and excelling in conservatory. “Using a time management app or chart is sometimes helpful to see where the hours of the day go.”

Although students expect more fun in conservatory, the work is rigorous and can be time-consuming. “I love drawing, but because the assignments or projects were for school, it felt like homework, like an obligation instead of something I enjoy,” said Alyssa Cho (VA ‘26). “So, I tried to implement things that I liked into projects.”

The big reminder heading toward summer? Don’t procrastinate. Get a calendar so that you can work ahead, and prioritize assignments. “There's a few weeks out of the semester when conservatory gets really hard with performances or events, but otherwise, it should be somewhat manageable,” said Tim Yip (IM '25).
