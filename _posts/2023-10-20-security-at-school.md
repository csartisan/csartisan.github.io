School security dominates national headlines. Concerns about rising rates of violence across the country have led to the implementation of new policies to keep students, teachers and staff safe. This includes practicing emergency drills, educating students on what to look for, and implementing technology to enhance safety around campuses. But what does school safety look like at CSArts?

School-wide drills prepare students and staff on what to do and where to go in emergency situations. Staff is also trained in overdose prevention, including the safe administration of Narcan. 

> As administrators we’re trained in various ways, CPR and First Aid, and we have a nurse. If things are happening, we've been trained on how to respond,” 

assistant Principal, Nicole Read, said.

CSArts continues its dedication to campus safety by contracting security staff. The presence of security guards, according to Read, increases the safety and security of the campus, as they can directly identify and manage any kind of internal/external security threats. 

> Say Cheese, students! You are on camera!” 

Security cameras are peppered around campus and school administrators say these additions are instrumental in maintaining security. The video cameras provide visuals and double -check student or staff observations of potential security breaches. 

> We typically have only used them after the fact. So if something is reported and we have to do an investigation, we pull out footage…we can go back and get the information,” 

Read said.  

Recently, the school implemented a new form of surveillance that uses live-streaming. The hub for these cameras is in Mr. Metoyer’s office, in the form of a big screen above Mr. Metoyer’s door. The cameras, video and live streamed, in tandem with the other security measures are instrumental in addressing real-time security concerns on campus. 

> Mr Metoyer saw some people behind the 400s…that didn't look like students, and it turned out to be parents on some kind of a tour, but it was like- what's going on? So he radioed security and they checked in,” 

Read said. While in that instance there were no problems, students and staff should know that the combination of training, staff security, bathroom sensors and the newest technology is keeping The CSArts campus safe.

Students are taking notice of the new additions. 

> I feel that the emergency stations on campus are a great idea. Drugs are becoming a big problem in school,” 

said one freshman student. The promotion and access to resources on assessing an overdose-related situation is essential, and will ensure that if there is an overdose on campus, there are people with training and Narcan to save a life.

While students and school administrators are trained and equipped, school security also relies on students. Students are here for the longest amount of time, and can more easily detect when something might be happening. That's why CSArts depends on the student body to use the resources available. 

If you see something, say something! CSArts also has a text-to-tip number that you can use 24 hours a day at 626-531-1271.
