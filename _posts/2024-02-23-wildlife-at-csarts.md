The many insects and animals on our campus can help us to be mindful during the long school day, yet we often undervalue (and step on) them. While it’s true that countless things are more entertaining than watching, for example, several earthworms fleeing the rain, these animals have actually helped me to relax, and have become an anxiety coping method.

The activity of observing insects or small creatures is calming because it is repetitive and slow, similarly to yoga. Over time, it can become a trance where nothing exists except for the animal. Naturally, if the mind is engrossed in watching the animal, it cannot worry, and will be at rest. When the trance ends, and if the mind is given time to rejuvenate with sleep, food, and water, it will be able to function well.

Even if you live in the city and aren’t familiar with the outdoors, it's fairly easy to find creatures on campus. Mr. Crumley, who teaches Biology and Honors Biology says our campus’ location brings a diversity of wildlife. 

> Since it is closer to the foothills, there’s definitely a lot more biodiversity.” 

Crumley says that several species live nearby include: cougars, bobcats, finches, bears, and coyotes. And you can’t leave out the insect population. 

> You can pretty much find anything in the San Gabriel Valley area, your typical insects like praying mantises. The monarch butterflies come here during the season, so you might see some monarchs flying by here and there.” 

He adds, 

> If you go out to the field, actually, during the springtime, you’ll see a bunch of dragonflies out there.” 

Large animals, as well as small ones, visit CSArts occasionally. 

> I’ve heard we’ve had possums,” 

Mr. Crumley says. 

> A skunk or two found their home in the dance studios in the past.”

Next time you start to walk by a small animal, whether it’s a butterfly or a frog, stay a minute. There are lessons in how each animal lives–in the loyalty of the ants to their queen, in the way squirrels steal bird seed, and in the way worms cross sidewalks, unable to realize they’re almost getting stepped on. They’re just waiting to be found.
