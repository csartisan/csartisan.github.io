Why do we like Halloween?  Is it the sugar?  Is it the fear factor?  As journalists we have the questions and CSArts students shared their answers about the “howling” holiday! 

Out of thirty respondents, 86.7% liked Halloween and 13.3% did not.

Less than half of the people said they like Halloween because of costumes and dressing up. 20% said they like it for friends, family, and candy.  More than a quarter of students said they like the opportunities of being creatively spooky.  

> I like Halloween because people can dress up as whatever they want, and get scared and laugh it off,” 

an anonymous student said. 

> It is nice to see people express their interests in a very direct way,” 

Jimi V. wrote. 

> For me it is generally a light-hearted day, which I appreciate.”

13.3% of students don’t like Halloween. 

> I don’t like eating candy and the holiday is way too expensive,” 

said Braedon Y. 

> It also causes so much waste.”  

> I get triggered,” 

another student explained.

24% of students chose Nightmare Before Christmas as their favorite movie. Other movies such as Scream, It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, and Practical Magic were also included in the responses.
