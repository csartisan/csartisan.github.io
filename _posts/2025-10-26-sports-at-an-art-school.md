Are you an artsy student who loves sports as well? Do you long for the athletic experience of a typical high school? What if you could have both sports and art?

Physical education teacher Luis Gutierrez says that athletic opportunity awaits you. He is offering to organize sports games for CSArts students during lunch. However, these games have to stay inside the gym, limiting different options for sports.

"For us, we try to keep it inside the gym, so there's a bunch of kids that play volleyball, or they'll play basketball inside the gym," says Gutierrez.

But since he's stationed inside the gym and cannot supervise the field, he is unable to organize games out there.

There is a shed that contains sports equipment that Gutierrez supervises. He says that the shed contains many different kinds of equipment needed for PE classes. He says, "It's only for inside sports. I don't like to get footballs or soccer balls because the gym gets crowded. It just usually stays to volleyball and basketball."

Gutierrez says that he doesn't allow people to take out equipment to Northview Field. "In the past, we've had negative experiences where I give someone a soccer ball and they kick it on the roof or into the street. Or they just don't give it back. So I just tend to give the indoor equipment because I'm there to watch over it."

The sports options at CSArts are limited, but if you want more physical activity, pop over to the gym and talk to Gutierrez about volleyball or basketball. Or, you could bring your own equipment and play around on the field with supervision.
