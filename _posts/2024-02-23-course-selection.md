Honors, AP, and Citrus College classes are available at CSArts. If you haven’t taken advantage of these courses because you are unsure of the workload, we talked with students about the courses.

### Honors:

Honors classes are to help students prepare for college-level work. There are many options on campus, including: Honors Biology, Honors Chemistry, Honors English, and other language classes. “Honors Chem is a lot of work and challenging at times, especially if Chemistry is not a subject you are interested in. But once you understand the topic it gets easier.” If you take an honors course, you can expect more rigorous assignments and an increase in homework compared to CP classes.

### Advanced Placement Courses (AP): 

AP courses offer even more advantages but students should expect an 5 additional hours of homework per week. Although AP courses add on extra work, students have the option of taking the AP exam at the end of the year to get college credit, plus they look very good on transcripts! Some examples of AP classes that students have said have nightly homework: AP U.S. History, AP World History, AP Physics, AP Statistics. 

### Citrus College Courses:

Students can start their college career at CSArts!  While performing well on the AP test can get you possible college credit, Citrus College classes are college classes, with college credit. The classes are challenging, but they also help students shave off time until graduation and save money. 

> The Citrus College courses really helped me understand what it’s like to be in a college class and equip me with experience for after I graduate,” 

said MJ Cho (CW’24)

Additionally, if you take an honors or AP class, your GPA goes automatically up one point. This means if you earn a C, the C will show up on the transcript, but that 2.0 GPA, changes to a 3.0!

Everything you need to know about all the courses is in the CSArts curriculum handbook. Hopefully, this gives you an idea of what you may be interested in to select your courses for the next year!
