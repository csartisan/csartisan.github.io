Transferring conservatories at CSArts is a major step that could open new doors for growth and creativity, but making the transition seamlessly, requires thoughtful planning and a clear understanding of the process. CSArts principal Nicole. Read shared her advice in a recent interview, offering insights to help students and families navigate this important decision: 

### Tip #1: Start Early and Be Punctual

Mrs. Read emphasized the importance of starting the transfer process early– and not procrastinating. “I would do it ahead of time, don’t wait till the last minute– oftentimes students forget, or they’re a few days late with their submission,” she said. “Conservatory directors really hold this firm line because they believe that your punctuality and submitting a transfer application shows you’re really serious about it and that you’re not just escaping a situation in another conservatory.”

### Tip #2: Understand the Timing

A key point Mrs. Read clarified was the timeline for transfers. “A common misunderstanding that families and students have about conservatory transfers is that they think it’s for the next semester, but it’s for the next fall,” she said. “Directors plan budgets based on the number of incoming students for the next academic year, so mid-year transfers aren’t possible.” 

### Tip #3: Leverage Teacher and Mentor Support

Mrs. Read encouraged students to involve their mentors and advisors in the process. “Certainly all the directors and teachers are willing to discuss with kids whether they think it’s a good fit or not,” she said. Seeking feedback from those who know your strengths and goals can provide clarity and confidence. 

So, start early, respect the timeline, and leverage support of teachers and advisors.  As Mrs. Read put it, “If you’re thinking about transferring, just go for it! It can’t hurt– find out if you can transfer. Even if you decide not to, at least you’ll know your options.”
