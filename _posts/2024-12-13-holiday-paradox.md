Food, family, and fa-la-la-las… I’m sure you thought that those good times would never change. However, as we grow older, the spark of the holidays seems to fade. Why does our perception of time change so drastically and what is the impact?

This phenomenon is known as the Holiday Paradox. When life is full of new experiences, like the excitement of celebration, time seems to slow down. As we go through life, these moments become less memorable.

Dr. Cindy Lustig, psychology professor at the University of Michigan, puts this into perspective. For an 8 year old, she says, a week is a significant portion of their life while for an 80 year old, it represents a much smaller portion.

“It feels like the days are blending together, which is both exciting and scary at the same time. I remember Thanksgiving and Christmas being such a big deal, but all the experiences that come from being a teen have changed that,” sophomore Katie Chiang said.

“You have to intentionally make things more special, especially since the memories of waking up and expecting Santa Claus wains over time,” Journalism teacher Mr. Blair said.

None of us know how much time we have left. The Holiday Paradox leaves all of us with an important message: make the most of the present and appreciate everything.
